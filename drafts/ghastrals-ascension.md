# Ghastral's Ascension

On a mangled and derelict ship wrecked in the aftermath of a violet space

battle , A Ghastral sat on a man's chest.
"Alive? I doubt for much longer.", it gave a little snicker. Its body was plump
and fused with the head. Its skin was warty and wet like a toad's and from it a
pungent steam eminated. Its voice was raspy and unusually deep for a
creature that could sit on a human's hand.
"I've just decided I can't hope to understand you."
It spoke through a wide mouth filled with sharp, generoursly spaced teeth. It
made no mitigation for a trickle of a black drool flowing over its bottom lip and
chin.
The man coughed and tears escaped his eyes.
"I warned you of this ending..."
The creature bobbed up and down as the man heaved by way of sobbing.
"..and it makes me sad to see you this way..."
A sadistic grin grew on the tiny monster.
"... Broken and humiliated by he... he who is not worthy..."
The grin grew to an obserdity.
"He who has stolen all from you and he who has made it his own...", it trailed off
into a slow and minor rumbling snicker.
The grin dimenished and the creature became more puffed and redish in color. More steam escaped from it's body. It held a tiny crystal that glowed with a
color never before seen by man... a dark hue. It shoved the crystal before the
mans face.
"And Still You Reject the power to make things right... you reject my little
trinket. tisk task, my human."
The man gritted his teeth.. The eyes of the little menance began to glow like red
embers.
"there really isn't a case for further moralization. He's brought you low. At the
point of death... now all that's left is the word. so say it. just say it."
The man forced his mouth shut.
"Say the word, my human. Say it. I can't stand to see you in anguish for another
moment. Please. say it. And all this will go away. Say it. I beg you to say it"
Tremors broke over the man's body. The little terror's sickly smile eased back
into existence.
"Why do you protest at this late hour? I have told you of the other human we
Ghastrals court. He is so very close to saying the word...so very close... you
know I know this And once one human says the word I'm affraid our masters
lose interest in all other candidates. Don't let me lose all the work I have put
into you to my rival. Think of me! Think of me and say the word" With little strength the man put his hand over his mouth and clenched his eyes
shut.
"Say it now or accept the injustice forever!", it shouted:" NOW SAY IT! "
The determined abomination hopped on the mans face and peeled the his
eylids open. Its own pupils were now red rings that slowly expanded beyond
the blacks of his entire eye to be replaced by another growing ring in its center
and another and another....
"The moment is nigh, human... he will take it from you! . SAY IT! SAY IT
NOW!!!!!!!!"

Suddenly the man violently writhed and spoke three sylables: "ASC-EN-
TION!!!"

The Ghastral's grin grew so wide it looked to split his ace in t
A hot batch of steam exploaded enveloping the creature and the man. The
cloud seemed lit within with the dark hue from the crystal which now shown
'brighter' than ever.
"Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! YES! You Have done it! and Just in time. I knew it would be
you. You will now be made into someting beyond HIM my human! Ha! Ha! Ha!"
The smoke cleared and where they had gone no one can tell.
