This document is meant to outline the history of the Androsynth program and update the public on our recent advancements in this field.

The Androsynth development program has been making advancements for the last 100 years.

An Androsynth is something much more than a human being that has had technological augmentations clumsily bolted on to form some sort of cyborg monstrosity. An Androsynth is born as an Androsynth.  To create an Androsynth a human fetus is taken – always a damaged one that cannot survive a normal gestation – and that fetus is allowed to develop in a matrix filled with nano-fluid which weaves technology into every cell of the growing mass and fills in the missing and damaged organic parts with technology.   The result is a human that is very elegantly blended with technology down to the cellular level.

Androsynths possess a childlike demeanor– as a matter of fact some do not age past being a child no matter how old they are.  They are always highly intelligent displaying extreme proficiency in technology, mathematics and scientific reasoning–Yet they lack some common sense and basic social skills.  They are also prone to being uninterested and unable to understand certain situational stimuli that most humans would find worthy of observation and consideration–for example androsynths are completely unable to understand politics, sarcasm, and humor of any kind and as a result they filter out their environment unless they are directly addressed and when directly addressed they can’t seem to process the information enough to have a meaningful conversation.

The overwhelming utility of Androsynths is their ability to mentally interface with computers.  Many normal humans have cybernetic brain implants to communicate with systems and to experience simulations. However the interactions are quite limited.  A typical human cyborg has a limited vocabulary consisting of basic commands like *“Turn on the light”* or *“summon warehouse item \#123 .”*   In contrast an Androsynth’s brain is fused with technology at the cellular level and throughout the entire brain.  This unique configuration–impossible to insert into an already developed human–leads to an Androsynth’s fluidity of thought that flows naturally into computer commands and back again.

Astonishingly newer Androsynths also have an *Actuation Number* which is the number of complicated systems they can control besides their own body.   Among the Androsynth there were many Bi-Actuators and Tri-Actuators.   The record Actuation number was an Androsyth that has since been killed who was a Quad-Actuator.  Their actuation number allows them to control something as complicated as a warbot or a space ship with complete precision  AND of course they can simultaneously control as many bots as their actuation number allows.  They can also control their actuation number plus one if they have the luxury to remain absolutely still in a technique where they give up control of their own body in order to control one more system.

The Androsynth program was just a research project initially and suffered many failures in the first 25 years which resulted in ethical complaints and calls for the abandonment of the project.  Luckily a breakthrough was realized creating the first capable Androsynth:  *Py-Ro*. This androsynth was blessed with a detailed understanding of fluid dynamics and demonstrated his precision in controlling a maelstrom of super hot plasma directed and contained in great precision by Py-Ro using a variety of force fields.  Py-Ro-3–most often referred to as just “Py-Ro”-- is the direct successor to the original Py-Ro as an Androsynth’s core can be reused many times creating a new being with the memories and some abilities of its predecessors.

Later models improved on the Actuation number and produced the first quad actuator *Dee-Fau* fifty years ago who sadly died in a brief war skirmish with the warmongering *Offus* species.

My work began ten years ago. In that time we have made fantastic advancements towards mental stability with the failure rate dropping from 50% down to 20%. That’s correct, prior to our work 50% of androsynths had to be culled due to various mental problems that made them unusable.  That sounds heartless and indeed it breaks my heart to deal with failures but we must keep in mind that these were fetuses that were 100% destined to die and their only hope was playing the odds via the Androsynth procedure… many lived meaningful lives but just as many perished. More importantly we euthanized failures because it was the only way to relieve them of the hellish emotional chaos that rattles in their defunct minds.

We have also made great strides in integrating new technologies into the Androsynth’s body.  Before my tenure Androsynths were a marvel of human ingenuity yet it had no innate abilities meaning it had no exceptional strength, integrated weapons or mobility enhancements.  An androsynth from my predecessors could only truly shine when it was interfacing with a computer.

We are showing great promise in introducing basic technologies like super strength, a finger beam and basic hovering/flight capability.  We are working on more features but are currently blocked by an unfortunate limitation we encountered which is that we are not able to install ALL of the enhancements in a single Androsynth forcing us to choose different subsets of features.  Fortunately these modifications can be introduced after the Androsynth is born which gives the Androsynth great flexibility based on his or her wants.

I look forward to our continued dialog over the future of our Androsynth program\!  Please contact my office to schedule a tour of our facilities guided by none other than me\!
