## CHAPTER 2 SLEEP DISTURBANCE

One hour after the annihilation of the Zell, the Red Destiny drifted peacefully.  Its main power source was literally fused into a molten mess, it could no longer defend or attack; It could barely move.  Auxiliary power supplied life support and minimal communication.

In the darkened bridge Alexander napped with his captain's seat fully reclined (another specialty of the Red Destiny \-- no other captain's seat in the fleet could recline.)  Fae interacted with her capsule in silence.

Their recent handiwork on the Zell fleet filled the entire vid screen.  The plasma field had cooled to a mass of super hot gas forming an opaque barrier between The Red Destiny and the Flotilla and Alliance Fleet.

Suddenly squawk on the comm channels signaled a much anticipated message for Alexander, “Slyther\! Have you found him\!?”

“Admiral Mudd cannot be found… most likely blown into space.  We continue to search but there is a lot of debris after the battle.”

“And Pete”

“Yes\! Pete is alive and recovering.  He was found unconscious but will be made completely well our medics predict”

Alexander reclined back in his chair, “What a relief.” He terminated the comm with Slyther.

A small detachment of the Ronin fleet had advanced beyond the Red Destiny pursuing the remnants of the Zell fleet.  Even though the principal elements of the Zell fleet been annihilated their rear guard, several reserve formations and support ships that lurked behind the flagship were unharmed by the Red Destiny's blast.  Victory for the Human fleet was assured, however, the Zell did not stop fighting and the Ronin fleet adopted cautious tactics in order to minimize casualties.  The Ronin Fleet faced another couple of hours of tedious slaughtering before the battle could end.

A communication came over the vid screen.  "Commander, we anticipate the mop up to last about two more hours.  Shall I have your ship towed back to the front line?"

"Negative. Commit all resources to the mop up we don’t want to endanger the men.  Retrieve us upon your victorious return.", Alexander didn't even open his eyes."

"Aye Aye sir\! And Great work\!"

Alexander's only response was a smile.

“Why for you won’t take a tow?  Men not in danger\!", Fae asked.  Lies completely confused her.  Lies from Alexander fascinated her and Alexander was accustomed to being questioned by Fae after he emitted the smallest of white lies.  He always took the time to explain to Fae in as much detail as she wanted.

"No. I just want to sleep. They can handle the rest."

Just then an unsettling thing happened.  A “red light” – or at least that is how best it could be described– passed through The Red Destiny and every other ship in the fleet.  Alexander and Fae could “Feel” the light cross them like some type of energy phasing by. The light wasn’t really red or a light but sort of a subtraction of light and yet also not a shadow.  It was quite simply impossible to explain and all who felt it shuttered.  But it seemed to have no effect so life quickly went on.

Alexander had followed up his victory with the usual transmission of a prepared message and a speech to the entire human race.  Just as his fleet would not relent against a broken enemy, Alexander sought to crush every last remnant of his political opposition.

*"I apologize for being so insistent.  I will never desire to oppose the will of the people.  But the polling my rivals conducted was a fraud and we still do not know the true wants of the people."*

*"You have witnessed the greatest military victory since humans first engaged in astro battle.   This victory was brought because of you, the people, the ones who have endured thirty years of Zell torment, the only ones left."*

*"What if I told you our nightmare could be over tomorrow?  That is right.  We can defeat the Zell. For just as humans regard the three remaining habitat spheres as the future of the human race; The Zell have only three planetary hatcheries that is their only future.  Years of scouting and analysis have revealed this to us."*

*"Presently we sit at a point equidistant from all three hatcheries.    We know the rivalries between Zell hatcheries run deep; deeper than their rivalry with humans.  The Zell, as predictable as ever, have abandoned their protective posts and rushed to destroy the humans, to claim the glory of victory for their hatchery."*

*"In another twenty hours the Zell fleets will reach a point of no return where they will not be able to turn back and defend their hatcheries if they are attacked.  Their precious hatcheries will be virtually undefended."*

*"For the rest of the plan, I ask you to have faith in me.  Trust in me as human-kind's humble protector for the moment.  I pledge to deliver victory.  I pledge to free you from the Zell Nightmare we have experienced for the last eight years.  I pledge to bring a new age where human kind will once again flourish."*

*He paused for a while.*

*"My opponents, the Representatives I speak of, put a question to you earlier today.  They asked in effect 'Do you believe humanity would be better served under our stewardship?'  They claim you have said yes.  But they are deceivers and the polling results are merely their latest concoction, the last lie they will ever tell.   Whatever the results they have asked the wrong question.  I put the question to you: 'Do you choose Eternal Retreat or Eternal Victory?'  I put this question to you this once, and will abide forever by your decision, as we will never have an opportunity again.  We will have a vote in one hour.  Choose the fate of humanity wisely."*

After he ended the transmission Fae asked, "Why polls so false?"

"I don't know.  It's how politics are done, I guess.", Alexander answered.  "Slyther will falsify the results of this vote if the legitimate results do not fall in my favor.", He then leaned back and started his nap.

The poll results started to flow in an hour into his nap.

"95% approval," Fae commented.

Alexander opened one eye to look at the polling results on his vid screen, "Savor the adoration of the people today.  Tomorrow we will start in our new roles of being the greatest mass murders in human history." He went back to sleep.

A short time passed and Fae became interested in some new instrument readings… She summoned multiple screens and started reviewing sensor logs.  The ambient sound in the bridge changed to the beeps and audio interactions of Faes computer interface.

The change in ambient sound alerted Alexander.  He opened the same one eye... as if that eye was less asleep than the other and he observed Fae for a moment.  He closed his eye and hoped Fae would sort out the matter without needing his involvement.

But Fae kept summoning screens and scrubbing through log data and it began to bother Alexander.

"What is it, Fae?", his eyes were still closed.

"Anomolous phenomenon."

"Good", Alexander thought.  Unexplained phenomenon was not his bag.  He allowed himself to start a descent into a deeper sleep.

Five minutes passed and Fae's confusion grew.

"Alexander?"

"Yes, Fae?" Alexander responded grogily.

"There is something in the cloud."

"Debris?"

"No. ship.  A Zell one."

Alexander sprung to a sitting position.

"Did it enter after the blast?", he asked.

"No contrail."

"Is it derelict?", Alexander hoped

"No. Energy signature,  accelerating and intentional maneuvering."

“Maneuvering where?”

“To Us.”

"What kind of ship is it?"

Fae ran some analysis for a few seconds and had an answer, "Dreadnought."

"The Dreadnaught?  The same flagship?"

"No.", Fae Reported, "It will get closer we can scan it…."

A couple of uncomfortable minutes passed. Alexander abandoned any hope of returning to his nap and inclined his captain's seat.  They waited in silence, there was no point in taking action until they understood what they were dealing with.

Five kilometers from the Red Destiny the gas cloud seemed to cough up the mystery object.  A large Zell ship emerged trailing swirls of gas that seemed reluctant to release its guest.

"It's the flagship.", Fae updated

"How? How could it have survived\!? It doesn't have a scratch\!"

"Negative.  Not the flagship we blasted. It is THE Zell Flagship.  The Eight Ball."

Zell battleships were not named by the Zell, but particularly scary or important Zell ships would earn a title among the humans.  "The Eight Ball" was the super flagship of the entire Zell race.  It superseded control of all three hatcheries and allowed the entire Zell race to act as one species.  No fleet had ever seen The Eight Ball in person and survived.

"Are there any more?" Alexander Asked

“No”

"Where is its fleet?", He asked to himself.

"Summon the Ronin fleet.  Abandon the mop up.  We have to destroy this ship."

The Eight Ball drifted forward and was heading directly for The Red Destiny.

"We are completely defenceless?"Alexander asked.

"Besides small arms, we have no defence"

"Can we escape?"

"We have enough power for maneuvering thrusters.  We can produce enough velocity to get out of the path of the Flagship, but if it steers towards us, we cannot escape it.",

"Contact my cavalry.  Command them to leave the Ronin fleet and come to our position at maximum speed...  And Remember this Fae, always consent to a tow when it is offered.  Always."

"I will remember not to lie."

Alexander nervously observed his tactical display watching The Eight Ball and his cavalry approach The Red Destiny. There was no way the Calvary could arrive in time.

At one-kilometer The Eight Ball came to a complete stop and did nothing.

"No Fleet, No Shields, No attack... what's their game?", Alexander pondered aloud.  "I sense a trap.  The Eight Ball would be a prize of a victory for our side without question. It's being dangled in front of me just as I dangled the Red Destiny in front of the Zell.  And If I was Zell, surely I would abandon my ship and attack.  But a trap is not needed.  We are the defenceless ones.  We are completely outmatched at the moment and our rescue cannot arrive in time to spare us if they attack now.  So what is their game?"

"Alexander\!", Fae said excitedly.  Her excitement was the clearest indication that she had discovered something very bad she summoned a large situational map of the entire theatre.

And then Reason and Reksep broke in on the comms: “We are surrounded.”

“The Red Destiny?”

“No, The entire Human Fleet is surrounded”

There were few times in his life that Alexander was stunned into complete inaction.  This was a moment.  Absolute horror swept through his body.

His inaction began to thaw and he started the process of discovery that would bring about victory, a process he had gone through many times but never inside what seemed such an impossible situation.

Alexander: "Estimated size of the Fleet?"

Reksep: "Uncountable. “They surround us from every angle in a spheroidal formation.”

Alexander experienced a second bout of petrification after Fae brought up a tactical view of the Zell fleets closing envelopment of the only remaining humans in the universe.

Again he struggled to find the right questions to get the victory discovery process started.  He decided to start with 'How.'

Alexander: "How could they have flanked us like this?  Do you think they can now cloak?"

Reason: "The vessels appear to be the same that were closing in on us before, the ones that had an arrival estimate of twenty to fourty-eight hours.  In an instant they have advanced to within one-half hour before they close."

Alexander: "Some kind of light distortion, they tricked our sensors to think they were far away?"

"Impossible." Fae said confidently.

Alexander thought for a moment.   "No\!  Fold technology\!?"

Alexander: “Fold Tech?”

Reksep: "I do not detect evidence of a fold, but it cannot rule it out."

Alexander: “Well, thanks… no way not knowing that isn’t going to lead to a strategic blunder…”

Reksep: "Fold systems consume massive amounts of energy.  Typically a fleet is bunched together and transferred in one giant fold bubble.  To surround us in an instant at trillions of positions far apart from each other would require a trillion fold systems and untold amounts of energy.  Am I right?"

Reason: "You are correct."

Alexander: "Are the Zell known to possess that much power?"

Reksep: "From our Analysis the Zell do not have enough energy to make a single fold."

Alexander: "Is there any evidence of the Eight Ball folding into the gas cloud?"

Reason: "Impossible.  We would know if it was a fold.  We registered energy from an unclassified phenomenon which was probably responsible for the appearance of The Eight Ball, but we have no better explanation of its sudden appearance other than 'it just appeared'."

Alexander: “Well that’s one thing.  At least we know they can’t fold.”

Reason: “Uhm, commander…. Its much worse… the Zell have a technology that we don’t understand that is far more dangerous than the fold system… they or some ally.”

Alexander thought to himself for a moment.  The 'how's' were getting him nowhere.  He changed his discovery tactics.

Alexander: "The Eight Ball.  If we decapitate the flagship it will throw the enemy into disarray.  Surely everything is being orchestrated from the Eight Ball... And the conditions to fight our final attack are met, the entire Zell fleet is here and the hatcheries are left unprotected.  How long will it take to jump the fold system?"

"One Half Hour," Fae Replied.

"Of course... initiate the fold systems, Fae.  Order the fleet to surround the habitat spheres in their assigned positions in preparation for all three folds.  Command our best attack forces, including the Calvary, to meet our position for a blitzreege attack on the Eight Ball. As soon as our attack commences reserve one cavalry ship to tow us to the Habitat-Sphere.", His confidence was only half restored, many unknowns confronted his plan.

"The Eight Ball is creating a spheroidal shield.  Two kilometers in diameter.  We are surrounded in it."

"More surprises from the Zell,"  He meditated for a moment.  "Cancel the attack on the Eight Ball. Summon a squadron of stealth ships to linger near our position and wait to tow us--maximum cloak. Prepare timed and event driven messages to send to all the players involved in the attack on the hatcheries.  Do not avail them to the entire plan at once, they won't have the stomach for it.", He paused, "I will board the Eight Ball and disable her shields."

Fae's Androsynth face showed a rarely seen surprise. She stood and faced Alexander.

He began prepping his armor for battle.  "I don't really need the cape, but it makes me feel more powerful", he said to himself.

"We are equipped with twelve warbots.  Prep all for battle, Six will accompany me and Six will stay to protect you and the Red Destiny.  Have my sword, shields and spear readied. Also prep a stealthy escape pod.  We will launch in a single line behind the escape pod, pointing towards The Eight Ball.  Hopefully the stealthy pod will make our arrival a surprise.", He continued to speak with half confidence.

Fae initiated all of Alexander's order with her mental connection to the Red Destiny.  Service bots began to scurry about the ship grabbing supplies, swords and taking warbots out of tight storage areas.  Fae looked on at Alexander, her eyebrows showed the slightest tension.

Alexander donned his helmet and began to descend a starboard side ladder that led to the forward escape hatch.

He stopped right where his chest eclipsed the floor and looked at Fae.

"Have a stealth pod ready for yourself as well.  At the first sign of trouble, eject in the pod and use the warbots as a distraction.  Wait for the all clear sign and then use your blades to requisition a tow.",

He looked at her face. Fae's eyes were swollen.  The number of tears shed by Androsynth throughout history could not fill a thimble.  Alexander recognized it for the important moment that it was. He hustled back up the latter, removed his helmet and approached Fae. She looked down. She was very slightly trembling.

"I go with you.  I am stronger.", Fae said.

His gentle tone contrasted the many powerful heart stopping speeches he had given that day.  "Fae, My best friend, as comrades we have accomplished much together and I do not believe our collaboration is meant to end today.  Still I admit--this fight has me worried.  But in every impossible situation an opportunity waits to be discovered.  Just as our defeat to Mudd seemed imminent, we discovered our salvation waiting to be plucked and turn our despair to victory \-- That situation seems like child's play right now, like it was a lesson we learned in another age, an obstacle we could counter without effort now."

"The Eight Ball has issued a challenge.  It's me they want.  If I don't go they will attack The Red Destiny and both of us will be lost for sure.  I have to go and go alone--it's our best chance to bring about a victory."

"I ask you to stay with the Red Destiny and preserve your life no matter what happens.  I ask you to abstain from observing this fight save for monitoring my vital signs as anything more will tempt you into rash action.  I ask you to complete our fight for the human race till the very end \-- it will not be much longer now.  I ask you to wait for the opportunity to present itself-- I cannot tell you what it will be as I don't know myself-- but you will know it when you encounter it.  If you do those things for me I am sure to return to your side.", he gently cupped her cheek with his hand.

A moment passed.  Alexander disengaged Fae, donned his helmet again and ambled down the latter in silence.

He opened the hatch and immediately was tractored out of the ship falling down, down, down to the evil Zell ship below.

CHAPTER BATTLE ARENA 8BALL  
Alexander woke in darkness.  He carefully stood and gathered his brains.  He diagnosed his body and felt no injury.  His armor was on and functional… his weapons and warbots companions were nearby.

The light improved and he realized he was on the surface of a giant floor… a giant giant cavernous part of the ship… with viewing stands.  It was a battle arena\!

The light improved more and both he and the Zell could see each other… the Zell let out a giant howls for their human hero.

And on the other side of the Arena a Zell brute entered through a giant door.

Alexander: “Summon Spear”  his spear lept off the ground and into his hand.   The Brute began to charge towards him.  Alexander pointed his spear at the Brute and said “seek & boost”  flame emitted from the back of the spear and it perforated the charging Brute right through.  The spear lodged in the arena wall and the Brute fell over dead.

The violence was well received by the Zell peanut gallery\!

Alexander sought an opportunity to talk to his hosts, but playtime wasn’t over he supposed and when it comes to the Zell playtime is slaytime.

An overzealous Zell jumped from the elite section into the arena–probably out of turn.  He was slightly larger than the average Zell warrior.  He was clad in an armor that merely protected his most vulnerable parts. Yellow warpaint covered his body and the armor. Two horns protruded from his back in a curved shape making a 'U' formation.  The horns had an uneven surface and ended not in a point, but in a dull rounded fashion.  They looked a bit like coral reef of ancient earth in texture and shape.  The horns were purely ornamental.  Upon both front hands a blade revealing a one handed sythe protruded.  Like most Zell, he walked on all fours, but the sythe weapons were pointed slightly upwards so as not to interfere with his walking.

The new customer walked in front of the dead brute and stood on his hind legs.

Alexander couldn't let a good sucker punch opportunity get away.  He swung his sword from above his head to the floor and released a sharp yellow crescent that hit the unsuspecting Zell enemy off guard.  The Zell was pushed back by the energy crescent, but he did not fall down, and his armor and hide remained unbroken.  The only evidence of the attack was a minor indentation running from his head to the base of his legs and some of his warpaint was blasted off.

"Your above average.", Alexander said

Alexander attacked again swiping his sword in a cross pattern that resembled an 'x'.  It was a more powerful attack, sending two slicing crescent simultaneously.  When performed by an expert the first crescent travelled modestly slower than the second, allowing both to combine the moment they reached the target.

His Zell opponent opened his mouth wide and a chaotic spatial distortion geometry appeared only two feet in front of him.  The slicing crescents struck the spatial distortion geometry and their energy was distributed in every direction some portion damaged the intended target.

Bolts flew from the Zell's mouth in rapid succession.  Alexander summoned his shield to block the bolts, and began a clockwise run around his opponent.  The bolts were noticeably stronger than anything he had experienced before and the shield struggled to hold. When the bolt attack subsided Alexander jetted towards the Zell and brought down a mighty blow of glowing yellow sword from above.  The Zell blocked with his right forearm armor, and a loud sound of metal clashing echoed throughout the cavernous room.  It was Alexander's strongest attack and did no more than add a minor dent to a piece of equipment that was clearly not new to battle.

Rapidly the Zell swiped his left Sythe towards Alexander's undefended midsection.  Alexander ignited his sword's retro thrusters sliding on his boots to a ten meter distance between him and the Zell.  A trail of red human blood seemed to connect the two warriors.  If he had reacted a moment later he would be in two pieces right now.  The Sythe now glowed with green energy. Alexander's blood sizzled on the blade.  He had a shallow horizontal cut spanning the length of his stomach.

Alexander's long shield zoomed in to bash the Zell.  The Zell was not pushed back, but he had caught the shield in his jaws.  With great effort he bit down on the shield and crushed it.  The shield could repulse the most powerful attacks, but was not designed to be vertically compressed.

He spit out the shield.  "Scum\!", the Zell said. "You die human\!",  The gallery approved of the poorly scripted dialog with rousing cheers.

"You ARE above average.   I have faced many Zell, none stronger than you.", He was stalling a bit for his numbing meds to mask the pain coming from his stomach.  “I’m so impressed I can’t wait to have you stuffed for my plunder room” Alexander added that to please the fans while he weaved in important talk… talk being the only thing that could save him from this situation.

"Tell me Zell, we humans have often wondered, 'why do you fight us?'"

Gra’all seemed perplexed.  He spoke slowly and calmly, “We made to kill humans. Humans made to kill us? Zell and Humans best friend.  Fight for fun.  When all humans die, Zell die too.”

“Ok” Alexander said…. He was a little taken aback that the human race faced extinction because of this absolute stupidity.

“And … yep, we love you too, Zell…. Do you think there is another way we could have fun together.  Seems sad it will all be over if one of us wins… maybe we can keep on playing.

“Welll, we like just kill you because You the greatest Man.  We kill the Greatest Man. We win. But then they make us kill the others too before we die. Less fun but better than build society or something… so bore.”

Alexander did not expect Gra’al’s answer.  Had the Zell been engineered to destroy the human race?  That would imply another entity that was the true enemy of humanity.

Alexander looked to the gallery.   “Who here speaks for all of the Zell\!  I request counsel\!”  But he was ignored.  As a matter of fact his flat words didn’t go over well in his fan base.  He caught himself and said “I wanna talk about Lets talk about turning this arena into a grinder and grinding all the zell to bits for a laugh.”  …. Audience recovered.

Alexander discovered there was something of an elite booth amongst all the rabble.  It was shaded and unclear what was really happening.  Behind he saw tree figures… in shadow. One was a tiny humanoid-like but frail and floating in a bubble of liquid without a tank of any sort.

The next was something of a robot…. It looked like a weird salt shaker with the top and bottom being symmetric with 3 thin legs and 3 thin arms.

And the fourth was a giant humanoid… probably  2.5 to 3 meters tall and covered in a cloak.  Alexander could barely make out this creature’s body–and the face was shrouded in sorcery  but his feet were exposed and they seemed exactly as a human foot would look like.  The cloak seemed to flow and wasn’t from fabric but some sort of energy.

In each case the creatures shared eyes of the dark hue. the same hue that Alexander felt earlier in the Destiny…. It was a color that subtracted rather than added yet that it was there was strongly felt.

Each of these three creatures seemed to have some sort of crown that hovered above their heads and followed them wherever they went.  The crown looked like some kind of rock and each was set a crystal glowing with the dark hue.

He appealed to Gra’al to get the identities of the 3: "Who tells you? Who is your master?", Alexander asked.

Gra’al shrugged…. The fight would have to continue soon.

He returned to scanning his enemy for a weakness.  He was settling on an unarmored section near Gra’al’s right arm pit.

The crowd started jeering.  If they didn't get back to fighting soon the entire stadium of Zell would rush onto the battlefield and kill both of the contestants in anger.

“Death is our master, Alexander”  the tall creature said. “Now kill him Gra’al”

Gra’al leapt towards Alexander. The crowd's attitude flipped immediately making approving noises for the latest spectacle.

Gra’al sailed in a Ten meter arc and brought down both Sythes upon Alexander's freshly vacated position, Alexander dodged the attack by one meter. Gra’al’s attack impacted the floor causing a shock wave and leaving a small crater behind.

Quick attacks from Gra’alls followed and Alexander did nothing but Perry.  The attacks were still strong without a jet assist from his sword Alexander would not be able to block his opponent at all.

They separated again, and Gra'al opened his mouth wide.  A spherical pool of green energy began to coalesce in front of this gaping mouth.  He put his scythes in the sphere and they absorbed the energy readily.  This next attack would be strong.

Alexander prepared his defence stance.  This was the moment he would defend with all his strength and the moment the attack began to subside his pre programmed sword would jet directly into Gra’al’s weakest point.

The Sword had one unique defence mechanism.  It was a blocking technique enabled by the adamant engine.  Similar to the exceed engine, which could temporarily nullify the mass of an object and allow it to displace itself at lightning speed, the Adamant engine worked by increasing the effect of mass of an object without increasing its weight.  When the adamant engine was engaged it took great power to move even an inch yet could still be held in place by the wielder.

The attack commenced.  Gra’als leapt in his traditional fashion and brought down both scythes towards his opposition's head.

Alexander positioned his sword horizontally right in the path of the concave side of the Sythes.  A great shock wave occurred when they met.  The power of Gra'al’s attack transferred through Alexander's armor and created a new crater. The adamant engine engaged in the nick of time and held the sythes at bay.  The weapons contradicted each other as Gra'al used every bit of his might to cut through Alexander's sword.  The sword edge emitted the brightest yellow energy. At the point of contact sparks

And Alexander's power was fading.  The power in his sword was diminishing and fatigue began to set into Alexander's body.  The two fighters looked into each other's eyes.  Gra'al pushed his mouth forward to get close enough to bite, but it was futile.  Alexander wished he had brought a dagger he could plunge into the vulnerable stop while he was protected by his blocking shield.

The powerful attack had been mostly spent and Gra'al began to withdraw for a new strike.  That was the moment.  Alexander triggered his sword to disengage the adamant engine, turn and jet directly into the left shoulder of his nemesis.  The sword penetrated into Gra'al body, but stopped at about three inches.  The blade did not pass the carapace layer and was another two inches from slicing into actual flesh.  Gra'al had grabbed the sword with his left hand and held it.

Alexander initiated an overload buildup in his sword.  He wouldn't get to deliver a detonation to Gra'al innards, but his outer layer of carapace would be blown off, leaving him vulnerable to an attack as weak as a fingernail scratch.

But in his enthusiasm to end his foe, Alexander had disregarded his defence.  Gra'al plunged his right hand sythe deep into Alexander's lower chest, piercing all the way through his body.  He lifted him off the floor and Alexander's body limped like a puppet that had its strings cut.  Gra'al cast him away several feet; Alexander landed on his back and slid for a few feet.

The crowd went absolutely wild.

Alexander's left lung had been pierced. His breathing was now labored.  His armor could not keep him in fighting condition with this new injury and the armor itself was greatly damaged.  Blood had spilled out of Alexander's mouth covering his internal visor.  He struggled to take off his helmet.  His head was revealed and he gasped for air.

The sword exploded knocking Gra'al on his back.  His shoulder section was completely exposed and green Zell blood flowed from his wound.  Gra'al laid motionless.

Alexander herd the explosion but was too exhausted to lift his head.   In his dazed state he did not entertain any pessimism, for example, he did not worry if the mission might fail. He was euphoric at the moment.

Tears streamed from the corner of his eyes over the sides of his face.  He looked up at the lights and imagined he was viewing the stars in the heavens. He gave into a delusion to himself that he had done it.  He had saved the human race.  He smiled and coughed up more blood.

And in the picturesque view of the heavens a face slowly crept in from below.  It was Gra'al.  He had survived the blast.  Dispair enveloped Alexander immediately.

Gra'al grabbed Alexander by the arms and legs and held him high.

"THIS IS THE GREATEST MAN\!", he shouted.  Predictably An Uproarious clamour of excitement hit a peak.

Gra'al lowered Alexander and held him by his shoulders and touched his feet to the ground... it was the only way Alexander could stand at this point.  His head was pointed downward and he struggled for air.

"How you want die, Great Man?", Gra'al asked politely.

“drop him.", a powerful voice said.  Gra'al immediately obeyed and dropped Alexander back into his previous position, on his back looking at the sky.

The humanoid figure was approaching.

Some complaining noises started to hum from the gallery.  The onlookers could not tolerate a momentary interruption of pure violence.

"shut up.", The figure said.

The noise continued.

"SHUT UP\!" The figure yelled, and from his right hand a bright magenta ribbon of energy surged outwards, he wielded it like a whip and brought it about in a circular pattern over his head.  Anywhere the ribbon touched, or anywhere even near the ribbon exploded.  of the twenty-eight thousand Zell watching, only about three thousand survived the whip.  The limbs and guts from the unlucky ones rained into the fighting arena.  The elite section remained untouched.

Gra'al backed away.  In a very un-Zell-like way he was afraid of the cloaked figure.

Alexander lay on the floor; he was now struggling to take deep breaths with his one good lung. He would inhale and hold it in for a few seconds then exhale.  The very weight of his own chest would suffocate him in a short while.

The figure came into view just as Gra'al had earlier.  Above his head floated something difficult to describe.  It was about six inches in diameter; spheroidal save for three fat and short protruding elements that pointed in three opposing directions;  It was made of smooth, black stone except for the very center of the front portion where a glowing 'something' resided. The glow of the dark hue.

The dark figure spoke in deep and gruff tones.  "You fool.  You endangered us all.  The reckless ambition of one man nearly killed the entire human race forever.”

Alexander could not retort in his current condition.

“I have hated you for years. I have contested you from the shadows and now I spit on you as you die."

"I want you to know that the fold systems will not work as you expect.  I saw to that myself. I want you to know The Ronin fleet will be obliterated to the last atom as there is no chance for escape.  I want you to know that there is no way you can defeat this enemy, no amount of hubris or luck can possibly harm your true enemy for they have power beyond your imagination."

Alexander filled his lung with air to speak but nothing came out… he returned to his futile task of recovering his breath to live a few more seconds.

"It may comfort you to know that the human race will live on, but they will never be free again.  Of course you have put your own ambition before your race time and again, and as you die I'm sure you feel no different."

The dark figure lightly stepped on Alexander's chest as he was trying to inhale one of his deep breaths.

"I want you to know who did this to you.  I want you to see who you underestimated.  I want you to see your better."  The figure gently removed his mask.

A glimmer of recognition twinkled in Alexander's eyes.

“Yes.  I beat you. Now, die, you scourge of humanity\!"

The figured stepped hard on Alexander's chest. Air rushed out his mouth. He twitched a little as he tried his best to take another breath, but he would never inhale again.

He crushed the last bit of life out of Alexander's body with his foot.

\*\*\*\*

In space, several kilometers away from the Red Destiny, Fae sat in the stealthy escape pod in a fetal position.  She had obeyed Alexander's command and had not observed any part of the battle.  She stared at a single readout.  It was Alexander's pulse.  It blipped more and more softly and then flatlined.

And thimbles worth of Androsynth tears floated through the pod.

THE BRINGLINGS PART 1 CONTINUED

CHAPTER 5

“Trina\! Trinadon\!”  Deebit shouted for his new friend.

She seemed in danger having fallen deep into the cave structure then  
triggering a cave in. It was dark, she was underwater a shallow pool of water  
and a boulder the size of her body pinned her to the bottom.

But such a predicament was nothing for a Bringing of any stripe as they are always imbued with many protection magics. Her flesh could not be pierced bruised, burned or  
bludgeoned by anything but a bringling weapon or spell and neither of those  
seemed in any supply in this current darkness and pit of despair.

"Breath," she said. And the water became breathable. "See" she said and her eyes  
pierced all darkness. "Strength" she said and with no effort she tossed the  
bolder aside.

She stood out of the water and discovered a rocky and windy cave path. Flanked by a fertility totem. Such things had been less interesting than slugs a moment ago but this totem seemed to grab her guts and stir the first inklings of womanhood within her.

"Trina" (Deebit now spoke in a psychic connection) Are you ok? He asked  
She noticed she had lost some blood. Impossible\!  
"I live" she replied tersely"  
"I'm coming down"  
"Don't." I think this is a place only for women.  
"I don't know what to do\!" Deebit said aloud  
"No man does" This struck Deebit funny.... it was the first time she hadn't  
spoken to him like an agemate.  
"I will find the Whysan Modus"  
"Yes.... do that thing. In the meantime I am fine."    
Who is Modus? She thought…

Compulsion swelled in her and she walked the path of the totem. It was not a  
long path, but it was windy and with lots of artifacts... it was an ancient place  
She surmised.... not seen since the time of Rhea.  She came across an ornate glassy cap for– some exotic and ancient container.

Drops of blood came from Trina.... from the fall? impossible. It was a very  
A confusing thing. She swiped a sample with her finger and marveled at the  
beautiful crimson color. She had never bled before or seen any Bringling  
bleed.  
The blood sprang from her crotch and in checking she could find no obvious  
sign of injury. The sensation was scary and yet right to her so she persisted  
on the path.

Around the corner the journey ended and revealed a steamy grotto flanked by  
flowers and beautiful fauna it was a place for things to grow..... from the water  
refreshing steam billowed and filled the room with a warm delightful humidity.

Then she looked at herself in shame.... blood covered her dress from the  
midline down. Several spells failed to rectify her bloody clothes and the  
The position and magnitude of the blood seemed like it would embarrass her...

She waded into the grotto and started scrubbing her skirt like some primitive  
tribe girl. The blood washed quite effectively, but started to cloud that part of  
the water red.... a red that no seeing spell could pierce so she ventured deeper  
into the water. More washing and deeper still she reached the beam of light  
coming from the ceiling. with her task almost done she stepped in something  
that lit within her a burning want.... the want burned indeed but what she  
wanted was unclear.

She reached down to her foot and pulled from its perch a handful of bright  
brown clay the likes she had never seen before. It felt better than anything  
she had ever touched and she began to knead and work the clay  
She grabbled another handful and another and then sat on a nearby rock to  
work on her new obsession.

"We cannot find you, Trina\! What bewitrary is this\!" Her concerned friend  
called to her through his mind, but Trina was now completely obsessed with  
her task though she could not have told anyone WHAT she was doing. With a skill she didn't know she had, a figure began to take shape. It was a little  
person, but the proportions were all wrong. A big head. Stubby arms and legs  
and a fat little belly. Eyes larger than they should be, and shut.... a nose like a  
little button and cheeks that she wanted to take a bite from.

Then it was finished.

Trina looked at the thing she had created and joyfully wept. And these  
feelings confused her.... to love something more deeply and more completely  
than the slug she had caught just hours ago seemed impossible.

Then a shutter. Something was watching her... something with yellow eyes. She recoiled.  
"SIGHT\!" she commanded but there was nothing there.  
"Trina\!" she heard over the psychic waves.  
She swattled her new creation not knowing what to do with it only that she  
would now protect it with her life.

She looked up to the ceiling light and said "Ascend" and gravity released its  
hold on her and she began to float to the crevice in the ceiling. As she  
approached she noticed it was the light of Kardia... the third moon shown its  
light into the grotto. She had before always seen Kardia as an illformed  
potato of a celestial body, but it now seemed more like a floating and beating  
Heart.

She floated from the cave and hovered 10 meters into the moonlight cradling  
her clay thing.

"Its you\!" a figure riding a gondola came zooming to her position. "Float" he  
exclaimed and leapt from the gondola to take Trina into his arms.... she allowed him to  
hug her but used one hand to protect the bundle in her other arm from being  
crushed. I searched for you, I was worried.. "Here is your slug"  
Trina was content in his embrace. "Keep the slugfor me for a while. I have  
something far more important."  
"Something you found? "  
"Something I found. Something I made. I could not have without you"  
"But... you are bleeding\! He noticed her torn skirt.  
"Not anymore I'm not. It was scary, painful and beautiful. I have never felt such  
A thing as this moment."  
Deebit guided his crazed friend to the gondola. We have to get you back. You  
need to see a doctor.

CHAPTER 6  FROM CLAY TO STONE TO FLESH

On the eve of the great conjunction many things were already coming together.  
For one thing all the various couples living in the various huts near the nine  
steps of Rhea performed the ancient love act prolifically. It was a vestigial act  
but still fun.

Then the night gave to first dawn when the Marshal moon eclipsed the horizon  
and ignited itself with volcanic activity. The crowd cheered as fire and rock  
spewed forth from millions of kilometers away. The moon became even  
brighter as the deserts and valleys of the planet slowly became oceans of lava  
and lakes of fire.

The first sign that this was the day of fertility had presented itself  
The ceremonies would soon begin. A large and excited crowd gathered on a  
grassy nole across the lake from the nine steps. Bringlings not present to  
procreate per ce still enjoyed the party as they wined and dined on picnic  
blãnkets. Whysan servants used their magic to fulfill every Bringling desire and  
banish any scarcity of enjoyment.

Amongst the premium cabanas on the grassy nole it seemed some had still  
not completed the love act portion of the ceremony or perhaps they were  
being extra careful to follow the traditions.

Atop the hill of the nine steps was perched Rhea's throne. Marble and  
magnificent it had laid empty since the 2nd war of the Gud. And this chair was  
what the actual highly contested prize. If the moonline shone on a baby girl on  
This day SHE would be the new ruler of the Bringlings... she would be destined  
to inherit Rhea's power and delima, bring the 3rd and final Gudling war and end this world  
of Resolution so all may return to paradise.

But in the long years Bringlings waited for a successor there was a little  
conflict over those who sat on the flanking thrones those being for the king  
and queen regents.... the ones who ruled as they waited for Rhea's heir.  Presently Vallus and Regina Kastron assumed that power.

A new light pierced the skyline and that was the light of (2nd mood). Her light  
was made from radioactive crystals that glowed a bright blue on this day alone.  
The crowds cheered as this meant the ceremony could now begin. Maids cast off their clothes and gave their final affections to their lovers and then started to wade into the water  
grasping for the clay of life. Most took a while for spells did not work in this  
water.... one found it right away and shouted "Destiny"  The others did not like  
this and hastened their search.

From the 3rd hemisphere Kartia heaved from its slumber and began its fast  
travel towards its destiny with her sisters. Her fiery facade now just a glowing  
ember of green during the time of the festival she actually emitted less light.  
More cheering occurred as this meant the great conjunction was on hand.

All the maids had found adequate patches of clay and they worked furiously to  
mold them into babies. Some fared better.... others had hands fall off and their  
work sometimes just turned to mush.... if the process didn't flow the little one  
usually simply reverted back to regular clay and fell into the lake to be molded  
another day breaking the heart of the maid by in a way saying "Try again next  
Year"

Then a klaxon from the heavens rang out and all molding stopped.

The maids held their creations to the sky and a great pulse of energy came  
from the two moons bathing all in an additive light that is hard to understand. And when they brought their hands down from on high they no longer held clay but stone babies.

Trina fell to the ground. "What's wrong?" Dextrus asked.... Terrified she  
reached for her treasure .... it was not soft anymore but it was there.... hardened  
to stone just like the rest she witnessed. She now understood how Bringlings  
reproduce for the first time. Or at least how statues were made.

Maids left the waters and ran to their lovers and husbands. After sharing  
affections the maid would gently hand the new statue to her mate and he  
would sit on a stone and ponder the idol for some time. Often looking at the  
Dawny sky for inspiration.

On the paradise of Rheashashan much meaning came from the heavens. Because  
Kardia was not fully lit and the other moons were not bright enough every  
celestial body in the night sky was visible and to the Bringlings each star,  
comet and constellation represented a different virtue.

Trina's attention darted from man to man. She listened at great distance  
using a tele-auditory spell... technically not allowed but her curiosity was her master  
at this moment.

In each case the father would wait for the stone baby’s eyes to open.

Then each would speak unique words.

"You will take from me my virtue of strength and you will protect the things of  
our family.... I tell you to follow Hagi the star of they honest and you will serve  
your fellow bringling ... Wander, my lad. for we are of zathos the comet god and  
are destined to discover all the wonders of this great universe and one day  
perhaps also that of the previous life..

Each man in turn told the stone baby what to take from him, which celestial  
virtues to follow and how to live his life then the life giving moment would  
Come.

Then the babies eyes would close and their mouths would open.

Each man would deeply inhale and softly breath and kiss the lips of his baby and gently inhale into the  stone orifice.

The object would change from the statue and the earthen tones would fade to flesh tones .... more breath and more and the stone would begin to soften and make little twitching  
movements. Now soft and fleshy the man would kiss the tiny lips of the baby  
and insert the tiniest of breaths.... the lungs would fill and the baby came to  
life.... he withdrew his kiss and then handed a crying, moving and living baby to  
his mate.

Wails of joy could be heard all over the ceremony grounds. A new generation  
now made its way in this universe and the Bringlings continued themselves.  
Trina panicked. She realized the stone likeness in her satchel would stay  
that way if she didn't find a man to bring it to life. “Just when I finally thought they were useless” She thought.

In the stupidity of her panic she ran through the grounds looking for a man.... she fixated on one gentleman without a baby but was scared away by the painful looks of one of the woman  
who had just experienced a disastrous clay miscarriage.

On she ran. feeling the hardened body of her baby bouncing in her satchel...  
then... something felt wrong.... the shape was wrong... in full view of the festival  
she withdrew it in a panic and all who saw gasped\! It was not a  
baby but a sphere three baby faces.

A silent unease passed.

Then one man carefully said what all though, "Abomination" And this one word  
triggered the crowd into a frenzy. Women screamed and men approached  
aggressively as if to take and smash her statue.

She put it back in her bag and turned to run but a stranger grabbed her by the  
arm and more surrounded her. With a craze in their eyes men rumbaged  
through her bag and women began beating her and pulling her hair. One man  
finally took the bag and he and others ripped it to shreds and there was  
nothing inside.

"What sorcery is this?" "Seek\!" he proclaimed and he and all around were  
given super human sight for a moment... the world they saw looked blue and  
plain except for the thing they sought which to them shown as a blindingly red  
light. It sat there on a persons hand ... being held quite gently by a Whysan  
wearing a black coat with medium length flaxen hair squatting as if out of  
danger.

"There\! He has it\! Give us the idol", Whysan

"I don't think I will. I don't think you people will make very good parents"

Bringlings didn't like being spoken to like that from a mere Whysan and his  
words only served to increase their craze.

"Now come here girl. I know just how to save your baby"

"I can't get away, he has my arm"

"but you have his hand", Trina and the arresting man both looked down where  
he 'held' her and gasped. True he had her arm in his hand, but his hand was  
now cleanly cut off. He wailed and backed into the angry bunch now only  
concerned for his own health.

Trina made a run for it.  Modus joined.

"I was worried about this." They ran together as throngs of more Bringlings  
joined the mob.

"The pit you fell into is a forbidden fertility pit of Rhea... usually it makes  
things go wrong but maybe I can help you. Will you let me help you?"

"But the crowd", they will kill us"

"I can handle them..." Modus stopped... they had about 5 seconds of lead over  
the naked throngs trying to chew them up. "You want this? He held the stone  
head as high as his arm allowed... HERE\!" He threw the head up in the air with  
full force. it flew so high that it had to have been magically assisted.  
The mob surrounded but did not harass the escapees any further. Their  
attention was focused completely in the air, waiting for the three head to fall so  
they could destroy it.

“Close your eyes”, Modus said to Trina

Trina screamed and mashed her eyes shut.

In darkness: "I said I can help you... I still can, but I want something. Can you give me  
Something?"

The head exploded in such a bright combustion that the uplooking crowd  
became temporarily blinded and groped for counter spells to heal their eyes.

"Yes, anything...." she wept.

“You can open them now”, Modus said.

“Ok” she said.

“And then there is my wish.  Let me be bound to you as your Whysan advisor.  Grant me this bond for you know I will always protect that which is bound to me. I am both capable  
and determined more than anyone in this universe or the previous universe. And as you know it is impossible for a Whysan to betray that bringling to which  
he is bound.

Trina felt safe with this amazing whysan, " I agree" she said ....

Great\!  now this baby is a trimind and requires a binding unction to save.  The Kastrons are the only family on this planet that might have such a thing… but they will want the baby.  You will have to marry Gomert Kastron.

She crossed her eyes: “Ok”

At that moment thousands of heads identical to Trina's stone baby began to rain from the sky, rolling on the ground, plumping in the mud disappearing in  
the tall grass and sometimes conking people in the head.  
The crowd began to crawl on the ground seeking these decoys and destroying  
as many as they could as soon as they could all while modus took Trina's  
hand and made a run for it down a beaten path.

Looking back Modus laughed as a still blinded man grabbed one of the spheres and attempted to smash it over another bald man’s head thinking it to be another stone

"But you destroyed it" She said

"Destroyed what?" As he pulled her at top speed with his left hand The whysan  
held out his right hand and without looking the baby head sailed right into his Palm.

He then tore part of Trina's dress from a place that wouldn't compromise  
modesty and wrapped the artifact in cloth and handed it back.
