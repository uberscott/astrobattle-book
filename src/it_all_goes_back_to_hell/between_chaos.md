## CHAPTER 1 BETWEEN CHAOS

Less sailed down a hall in a legitimate panic.

“Critter. begin. Mode: Stealth.  (intrution) Detect \-\> Report @ here. Execute.”  Less commanded his most loyal bot in bit speak. ‘Hide here and report any intruders coming my way.’

Critter, a small monkey bot that clung to lester’s back lept from his perch to the wall and then scurried up to the ceiling behind and electronic junction box.

Less made a hard left turn skipping off course to preserve his momentum.  He ambled down the hallway of escape pods at speed that defied his unathletic build.

Less stopped at the second to last pod entry and pressed a button on the left shoulder harness of his Tactical Engineering trousers for an intravenous boost of oxygen laced blood.

He meditated for a moment as if his next move was life and death.  He stared at a bright red button that he merely needed to smash and the pod would open like a flower for him… but that would cause him a new problem.  For the button was single use… it was glass and would shatter after being smashed and that meant it would leave evidence.  So he focused on his cybernetic implants in an effort to hack the door open.

Why was evidence important? Because less wasn’t trying to escape from danger… he was trying to escape from work. Really boring work.

After Alexander’s stunning victory the field engineers would be celebrated and celebrating and that meant cleanup tasks (recovering bots, restocking ammo, repairing equipment and telemetry review) would fall to the Supporties .

Bump\! The door slammed open–the pod accepted him and then in a rush the door shut and the “pride” of the Tactical Engineering Corp lay ensconced in the pods tranquil oblivion.  Completely safe from the search of his better who would have him review telemetry for the rest of the day.

Less blipped into his fantasy world in quiet bliss right as the world around him descended back to hell.
