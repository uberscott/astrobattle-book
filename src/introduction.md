## INTRODUCTION 
Well hello there! You must have followed a link to my little work I call **Astro Battle**--A science fiction novel.

### FROM ASTRO BATTLE THE VIDEO GAME
Actually Astro Battle is quite a bit more than a novel for at one time Astro Battle was an online game that I wrote that 25,000 members enjoyed in the 2004-2004 era.

The premise of the video game was that player built his own custom ships and then fought each other in a multiplayer online deathmatch.  The challenge was to come up with a better design to outsmart the competition and there was lots of back and forth with maneuver and counter-maneuver, innovation and counter-innovation.  The members and I had a blast!  Sadly for personal reasons I had to take down the servers in 2008.

In this book there are space battles and then there are the **Tactical Engineers**: special warriors that apply science and engineering on the battlefield to outwit the enemy.  The Members--*the ones who played Astro Battle video game*--**ARE** the Tactical Engineers, and it is to them that this work is dedicated.

### A DRAFT IN PROGRESS
This work is a draft; a snapshot of progress. If reading something unfinished churns your stomach then you'll have to wait a couple of years for me to finish it.

I will politely listen harsh feedback--I proved that to the members some of whome had VERY harsh feedback!  Just expect that if I'm being gracious enough to endure harsh feedback YOU need to be gracious if I do not incorporate that feedback.  That being said I have history of considering everything and usually incorporate in my own way.
