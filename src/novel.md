## CHAPTER WHATS INSIDE IM-RY3 ANYWAY?

Lester now an ally of Fae\*Dra asked politely: “Before we go, I’d like to inspect the cube and make sure its contents are safe.”

Fae\*Dra seemed to approve.

Lester pressed a button and a circle on thecube ejected a canister.  He twisted the canister and through a clear material glowed a floating sapphire gem perhaps 2 carrots in weight… it was a Tzo chrystal.

“A Tzo Chrystal?  Is this what you were saving” Lester asked Fae.

“I rescued IM-RY3”

“So you had no idea what was inside it?”

Fae didn’t seem surprised but Lester was dumbstruck,  “What… is… THIS\!?... What is this thing\!? A TZO CHRYSTAL\!  Where is… .where is my… WHAT HAVE YOU DONE ALEXANDER\!”

In anger he grabbed the crystal which caused an unwanted reaction ….. “AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\!”  he yelled and for Lester everything went black.

## CHAPTER THE WISH STONE

Lester was falling through a warm and humid atmosphere. He felt great.

He struggled to orient himself, but realized his reaction control suit wasn't operational \--no \-- he was naked. The naked situation bothered him more than the terminal velocity situation but then he discovered he was not completely naked just wearing a thin garment he had never seen before. And with that priority addressed he could move on to his lesser concern: being as flat as a pancake in the next few seconds.

Without equipment he had little hope unless the garment could be fashioned into a parashute..... nope... little more than covering his privates.... not enough material.

He fell through the cloud layer and could now see clearly the planet he was falling towards. He was headed to a cliffside by a lake and there were structures. Ruins. It was a precursor planet Lester had not seen before, of course he wasn't well studied on the various precursor sites. He did his best to make a survey of the land before his skeleton became a permanent monument .

Closer he approached. He still felt great for some reason... all worries blown away even the present and deadly one.

And then CRASH\! he hit the ground and created a giant crater. He wasn't instantly knocked unconscious which was a bummer, he thought he'd have to die slowly and he did a mental diagnostic of his body to see what was hurting what would give out first... and he found nothing. He was completely uninjured.

He stood and continued to observe. He walked out of the crater and saw a giant rock seemingly pushed to its side and on it appeared some petrified foot prints that were .... human\!? They had to be millions of years old, how could that be there were no humans then...

In front was a cluster of three thrones and some sort of bird bath all in remarkably good condition. He was facing them from behind and decided to go around to see them from the front.

Then a startle... someone was sitting on one of the lesser thrones\!

It was an old but beautiful looking woman. She seemed thinner than an average person but just as tall and had pointy ears like some kind of elf.

She stood and bowed gracefully "Lester Man" she said.

Tactical Engineers weren't used to people treating them with respect... As a matter of fact respect made Tactical Engineers suspicious. But this lady did have a lovely planet and given the novelty of the situation he was more amenable to giving her a chance…. At the moment Lester couldn’t make himself speak.

“I must speak the words and speak them rightly for we have but a little time in this now.”

“We are the Bringlings.  We are called the Bringlings for we are those who brought this universe into existence.  Some think us gods – although my master rejects such arrogance.  Know that we are of great power and our deeds of heroism are seared into the legend of this universe.  But with time we grew weary and lost the fortitude to defy evil.”

“Gods wish upon a mortal to set something straight in this universe by giving that mortal his power.”

“That is why my master summons you, Lester Mann.  You are her hero and you will make this universe right again or we will all die.”

A magical block on Lester’s voice seem to be lifted.

“But what do you want me to do?”, Lester asked

“More explanations will come, for now know that everything you have done and continue to do is and has been right… we know this because the wish stone chose you”

“In parting you must know some small things.  You face an enemy with power beyond what ou and your companion’s mind can comprehend and are in great peril.   For today: “Run, Run and keep on Running. As you do so you will grow stronger and we will imbue you with many bringling gifts when you are ready.  Run and Run and Run and then one day you won’t run anymore.”

Lester felt a disturbance… the experience was about to end.

“Gift? What gift will you give me? How can i use it?”

“Your first gift has already been given… I lack the time to tell you about it but you will start to feel its presence soon… soon you will be able to use it.

The experience began to shift... colors and sounds became like they were underwater and Lester started feeling light headed.

"But who are you?"

"Ah\! That I can tell you, Lester Mann.... My name is Meru and I am at your service.

The dream ends.

HUMANS TO BE CONTINUED….

BRINGLINGS FINAL

# The Bringling Day of Gifting

On an unnamed field of grass and poppies under the graceful soar of giant preybirds in the kingdom of Wuskia on the Planet Rheashan in the galaxy of the milky way under the Bringling empire and in the universe of resolution a young boy named DyAd practiced swordplay with the prisoner Zetsway guided by the royal knight Deebit.

It was the Bringling day of giving an important day for all things bringling. For all that is got by a bringling is from gifting. And of great importance new skills, spells and magical trinkets are passed as gifts but to be worthy of the best gifts one must first prove his proficiency. And this is why DyAd toiled to secure and prove his skill before the ceremony.

But DyAd was more than a boy... he was actually a boy and two girls and if that wasn't weird enough these merged siblings shared the same mind. Together they were referred to as the Regent Apparent, but individually their names were Tres, DyAd and Monoli Wusk. They shared one body and their appearance would instantly change to the one who was talking .

On some gifting day perhaps today–but likely not–one of the two girls would be the inheritor of the most valuable thing to all Bringlings. It was a gift for girls since Bringling society was matriarchal and the prize was called ‘*The fruit of the Previous life*.’ Controlling Fruit of the Previous life meant absolute rule of all things in the universe of Resolution or so that is what was thought. No one yet had learned how to wield it.

Dyad couldn't care less about the superprize; he just wanted to be a more powerful knight.

His sparing partner Zetsway was an indensured summon of Deebit meaning he could be called to appear at any time and fight. Zetsway was a prisoner of the Bringlings for millions of years still paying off a sentence for a crime only he actually knew.

What he looked like was anyone's guess since an iron mask covered his face also making it impossible for him to speak. Something like a chain metal straight jacket bound his arms behind his back... the chain main ran all the way down to his legs and bound them tightly together too. Finally heavy chains wrapped around his body from his neck to his ankles. From behind his iron mask two yellow and longing eyes told a different story to every individual who thought they saw something in him. Lastly it couldn't be missed that he was filthy ... the only skin that was visible was his unshod feet and it couldn't be determined if he was humanoid feet or not because of the filth.

The aforementioned description of Zetsway makes him seem rather impotent and at this moment he was, but one would be deceived to think that was always the case.... for apart from being able to summon Zetsway from thin air Deebit could also release his confinements one by one. But doing so was said to be dangerous for every encumbrance that was disabled Zetsway became incrementally stronger AND incrementally harder to control. His full power was not known and yet he was formidable even in fraction.

Today Zetsway was living the lowlife by being forced to allow DyAd to swing his sword attacks which Zetsway had been easily dodging all day. It seemed cruel, but DyAd at his level still could not hope to scratch the mysterious Zetsway and so the training went on.

"Now hold steady and gather energy into the blade.... swing\!" , Deebit guided.

"You can do it\!" chimed in Tres.

Upon conducting a downward spin a large disc of wave energy was released from DyAd’s sword and rolled through the air leading up to Zetsway, but missed its target for Zetsway had already side stepped.

"Again\!"

Another swipe and miss. This has been going on for a while.

"They will not give you super speed until you can accurately hit a target while you are NOT moving..." Deebit repeated in frustration.

Monoli sensed her brother's anguish, "Don't feel bad, you are getting closer each time\!" (this wasn't true at all)

"Your eyes are betraying you" the voice was familiar but no one knew where it came from.

"Oh god, where the hell are you this time..", Deebit asked

"Hi There." the man was standing high atop a tree watching with a birds eye view and he wasn’t alone… a tiny Whysan girl no older than 6 stood beside him.  Both disappeared in a puff of smoke and smoked in again behind Dyad… the Whysan girl poofed in nearby.

Dyad then transformed to Monoli "Teacher Modus\!" and she hugged him with great affection. Modus smiled.

"Let's give our DyAd another chance. With your permission, Ser Deebit?"

"Yes , granted... " Deebit sat in the grass clearly weary from teaching young DyAd.

Monoli transformed into DyAd again.

Modus whispered so Zetsway couldn't hear. "He's predicting your aim and strike because you have put all your training and gifts in the pursuit of powerful strikes... and indeed the power of your strikes are formidable... but predictability plus power negates formidablity for you will never land a blow on the opponent wise to your strategy.

Moreover you have no time to learn bending techniques before the gifting ceremony. But you are not yet lost.

To solve your little conundrum I have something for you on this day of gift giving...." Modus produced a small trinket, a loose bracelet with a heavy bobble on the end.

"Wear this and hold the bobble against the hilt with your swinging arm. Now swing as usual and release your energy disc wave."

He does so. The disc wave tumbles towards Zetsway who predictably leaps out of the way.

"Nothing changes" said Tres

"Now try again... this time after you release your disc wave and when it reaches half way to your target let go of the bobble.", Modus instructed

Dyad pulled back and released a fresh energy wave... he saw the moment Zetsway jumped out of its path and then released the bobble.... the disc wave's path then began to arc to the left hitting Zetsway square in the centerline causing a giant smokey explosion"

Dyad transformed into Tres: "Wow\! Unbelievable\!"

Deebit sat up in excitement.

The dust cleared and Zetsway seemed unharmed which was expected.

Tres transformed into Monoli who shouted the spell "Celebration" which caused all the poppies in the field to explode and release a vast confetti of flowers that jetted as high as the stratosphere… and it caused the little whysan girl–who lacked Modus’s skill and the protection of a bringling–caused the girl to be blown high into the sky.

As she fell to the ground Modus caught her… she was covered in flower confetti and having the laugh of her lifetime.

"Who gives you those silly spells"

"Uh..." she looked at teacher modus ... " I don't know.

The laughing girl ran to Monoli Wusk and both gave each other a knowing hug.

“I bind myself to you as your Whysan, my master, Monoli Wusk”

Monoli was overjoyed, “I accept your pledge and bind myself to you… you… what is your name Whysan?”

“Meru”, she said.
