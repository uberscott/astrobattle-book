## Girl vs the ZELL

Lester's 3rd plan to foil the girl with super powers was by way of stealth and help from the Zell and most importantly he resolved to abandon ethics.

Of course Less and the Zell weren't allies, but it stood to reason that if she got into a fight with a large host of Zell she would either flee, leaving the cube or get killed.

Lester figured the Zell themselves would have no interest in the cube and when they left he could retrieve it later so long as a Tekanoin salt shaker parade didn't clepto its way through the aftermath later.

Less watched from an air vent high, high in the ceiling of a large spacecraft repair bay. As the girl casually walked towards the hanger \-- her presumed destination \-- two squads of Zell would be injected by Xor and Nand.

Anyone who thought they could herd Zell doesn't know the Zell, but Lester had a great plan. Lester had equipped Critter with his bomblets and given him a little training on the proper care and feeding of high yield explosives and sent him off to harass the Zell in various places. He also equipped the tiny robot with a megaphone speaker attachment so he could play recordings like "Zell are stink... They need ath bomb" BOOM\!

Of course such obnoxious behavior caused the Zell to chase Critter who was able to escape at lightening speed (including the ability to use exceed to avoid blast bolts and tractor whips.) And it was to this point, far below a large invading army of Zell spilled into the maintenance room spoiling for a fight with a little monkey bot who just zipped past a little girl as if to say "if you wanna get to me you gotta go through this single layer cardboard box first.

The girls stopped cold and this was a good sign that she knew she faced a challenge... the sinister agents of the Zell slowed as they approached her.  Among them were at least fifty rabble and three Brutes--each of whom bore a Zell boss. They would surely tear that precious thing to bits.

Lester’s look of satisfied anticipation gave way to a more empathetic expression, "What have I done." He whispered. But I have to have it.”  Then from her backpack some things emerged. One, Two, Three floating blades detached and surrounded her–their pointy sides facing the enemy. The blades were each about 30 centimeters in diameter and perfectly triangular.

Each vertex was a sharp cutting edge. They could fly in any direction but on one of the edges was a flattened booster.

"Kill her" a Zell boss fired off this command nonchalantly and a single rabble charged towards her... when he got near two blades stopped him by pressing their flat sides on either edge of his belly to give him a squeeze.  Trapped as he was he could not stop her from floating him directly over the Zell boss that gave the order to attack and while he hovered there the third blade cut the floating Zell in two releasing all its blood an innards over the Zell boss.

All blades returned to their starting position flanking the girl. The entire move seemed to be an

opening warning from Fae telling the Zell, "Don't try me"

"Sprawl, you moron... can't even kill a girl.... YOU ATTACK\!", the 2nd Zell boss thought he could do better and another non-descript Rabbel launched the exact same attack.

But as he approached he was bonked on the head by a suddenly appearing blade on the blunt side with such force that he did a back flip right overtop the 2nd Zell boss.  At the moment a second blade severed the animal in two right through the anus. Blood and guts rained all over the 2nd Zell boss.

"Ha Ha HA\! YOu crimping fools, you can't even kill a simple human without getting slop all over you." Lester recognized this Zell's voice for it was Vraylar once again.

"We really need to kill that guy next time", Lester thought

"We do not fear your trapazoids, girl", the first Zell said.

"They aren't trapezoids, they are rectangles\!", said the second Zell.

"Fool, you don't know your weapons. They are trapezoids because first they trap you then they slice you" said the first"Wrong, they are Rectangles... didn't you see how they enter through the rectum?"

"Idiots\!" It was Vraylar's turn to 'add' to the conversation.... "They are TriAngles, because I will win on the third attack with three Zell. I will demonstrait.... Triple attack now\!"

But before any assailant could take a step to threaten her all three in Vraylar's attack group had lost their heads and the girls weapons seemed to have returned already... ready for the next wave.

"Charge her\!" Vraylar said with anger fueled by his pride.... a LARGE number this time, between 20 and 30 Zell launched a melee attack... Fae\*Dra simply stood there, completely unconcerned. They pounced on her and tore the area to threads... then paused... one Zell looked to Vraylar and said "She's gone" Then a large piece of equipment fell from the ceiling killing all thirty asialants.'

Lester spoke to himself, “keep underestimating this one…”  The he saw the cube laying safely away from the carnage.  He didn't know where she was only that now was his time... with the help of Critter he began his decent to the surface.

"Where is she? Where did she go?" Vraylar said with bruised pride.

"yo." She replied. She was standing on Vraylar's brute directly behind Vraylar.

The two other Brutes saw this and lunged to attack her, but when they got there both her and Vraylar’s brute had been moved to another location in an instance..... the two Brutes ended up tearing each other to bits also killing their riders.

The remaining twenty or so Zell were now in a frenzy of fear and from atop the last Brute she fully released her three blades which started flying in a tight spiral pattern all around her position. Zell and Zell body parts were being tossed around like they were in a cyclone of razor blades with the girl in the eye

of the storm.

Less' feet were firmly planted on the ground about 10 meters from the cube ...he tip-toed as best he could to retrieve it before his distraction was done for.

The screams from the Zell had stopped, yet she let the 'blender' run for a few more seconds for good measure.

Then sillence.

Vraylar looked straight up to see the girl behind him.... he started yanking the reins frantically trying to get it to save him, then he looked down and realized he was sitting on a floating head.

The girl was pointing at him, presumably with a tractor finger causing him and the head to float. The body of the Brute was ruined on the floor and the girl herself was just floating in the same place before she decapitated her stand.

Vraylar undid his stirrups and the head fell to the ground.... the girl twisted him around to face her.

Less grabbed the cube and started running to the extraction point where

Critter waited to whisk him away...

The girl looked at Vraylar for a second then reversed the polarity and increased the pulse strength of her finger tractor sending poor Vraylar flying into a wall 300 meters away. Splat\!

Lester ran and was almost to Critter when all the sudden something hit him in the buttocks so hard it flipped him upside down.... as he sailed through the air he was hit in the butt probably another dozen or so times. And when he crashed in a pile of debris he realized the cube was gone.

"Spankings are for TacEng, because Alexander say no kill TacEng."

The Cube floated back to her, she turned and continued walking like she had just encountered a minor obstacle.

Pause of defeat…"I don't have a chance of beating her" Lester said as he rubbed his heinie.  But… she said “Alexander….”

He performed more facial closeups and did some image enhancements and cross photo computer analysis and then \-- no way. He recognized this person. This was his brother's Androsynth. Lester's blood boiled, "What in the hell is he doing with my vault cube\!" ... he furiously tried to raise him on the comms but nothing. Lester assumed he was in some battle somewhere... the world was going to hell but he wanted his answer anyway.

Ok. all bets are off. I'm going to talk to this androsynth before she gives the cube to Alexander. And if either of them get in my way all bets are off. I've beaten you before, you know…

## CHAPTER FAE\*DRA AND LESS

Fae\*Dra had entered the large aircraft maintenance complex and was calmly walking to the connected hanger.

Lester ran to approach her and yelled "Androsynth\! Stop what you are doing. That vault cube is mine\!"

"TacEng go away", she replied without breaking her stride.

"I know what you are doing.... I will use all force if I have to"

No reply.

Lester fixated on the cube... his obsession watered down his judgement. "Well, if that's how it is, send Alexander my regards".

BOOM\! In a flash a triangular blade instantly appeared in front of Lester's face.

It must have traveled at an undetectable speed. Lester could still feel strong air current pushing back his cheeks as the blade settled in thin air, vertical in orientation bisecting his face down his ventral line.

"Care what you say TacEng." ... the blade pushed closer with the tip pinching Lester's nose... "Else there will be two TacEng... one that falls to the left and one that falls to the right."

With that point made very clear to Lester he backed off of his plan to detonate explosives above her. He and his team were no match for this androsynth. The cube was lost to him.

He sat on the ground in despair...

"Why does he want it anyway? Why does my brother want with.--" with those words Fae\*Dra stopped, turned and looked at Lester for the first time... her eyes seemed to be making some computer analysis.

"You are Lester Mann... half brother to Alexander Holmes. You are the best TacEng in the Ronin fleet but lazy and disengaged." She was reading from a script because she wasn't talking like herself.

"Alexander sent you to help with mission?" She asked.

"I dunno... why don't you ask him?"

Emotion welled up... "Alexander is dead. I am to take biological sample IM-RY3 to reflex point."

Lester stood back up and softened his demeanor. Alexander was dead. His brother was dead.... and maybe he was trying to save the cube all along.....more emotion welled up.

"Let me help you."

Fae\*Dra repeated: "Lazy and unmotivated" like it was a rejection letter for a resume.

"The best tactical engineer in the Ronnin fleet. Alexander wrote that. He knew I could do this. And he also knew the ONLY thing I care about in this universe is in that cube. Take me and my companions and with your strength and my strategies we will complete the mission for sure."

A moment passed as Fae\*Dra thought

"Accepted"

CHAPTER THE FORLORN HOPE

They entered the hanger and witnessed as the red destiny was being worked over by bots just as it had been before the previous mission. This particular work was grueling as the previous core was being cut out having been fused to the hull. The cannon blast stunt that Alexander pulled also damaged many subsystems not meant to handle such load and much had to be replaced.

Lester was interviewing Fae\*Dra about the mission... he realized she didn't really understand what needed to be done but seemed confident in her ability to punch her way through her troubles. But he got most of his information from plans on file she shared with him.

"So the arks are going into a temporal fold....my understanding is that they will reemerge months or years later in another location having experienced almost no passage of time. Ok, that's good. But...looking at these readings something bothers me... it looks like the time dilation is such that they will unfold sometime after the end of the universe itself.... won't that be a problem?"

"We save them", Fae gave little nuggets of the plan that she didn't fully grasp.

"Yes, I see... a specific type of energy pulse (sorry this is not my field) will be used to dislodge the arcs near the Zell hatcheries and then the final battle will commence.... and how will that pulse be administered...."

"By the Ronin fleet" Fae\*Dra was annoyed to have to tell him the obvious

"Uhm.... the Ronnin fleet is almost decimated.... there is no way anything can survive without folding and now we know the fold itself is a ticket to limbo"

"Stop being lazy TacEng" Fae commanded.

"Can the temporal fold variables be modified?"

"No"

We're gonna have to make a run for it then.... I know you love your ship, but maybe we would be better off in a cloaking vessel.

"The Red Destiny is Alexander's ship"

"I know but Alexander is..." He didn't want to get cleft in twain for dancing around that tricky subject....

"Tell me androsynth, what is your actuation number?"

"6"

Lester was annoyed, "No I meant your actuation number... the number of machines you can control besides your own body?"

"6" she said again.

"6? Hex? You are a Hex Actuator?"

"Affirm." Fae\*Dra responded with muted robot pride

"Well now that's quite an asset" .... " Okay... we will make a run for it in the Destiny, but I will need modifications.. Using your credentials I have requisitioned a cluster of four boosters to zoom away. I'm replacing the core with a fusion core... antimatter is far more powerful but requires refueling. I am also having much of the inner battle equipment removed for we will instead need quarters for sleeping and eating and fabrication systems for repairing the ship in deep space... this ship is not made to fly a long mission like this without support after all.

Then a weird thing happened.... a hangar adjacent opened and an empty ship gently drifted to its moorings ready to be repaired and refueled. It looked exactly like The Red Destiny down to the last detail.

"What ship is that?" Lester asked.

"The Forlorn Hope"

"The Decoy ship used in the battle of ILLUS\!" , Lester realized\!

Well, this gives us quite a new asset. We might actually live through this. "Hmmm.... the forlorn hope...."

## CHAPTER WHATS INSIDE IM-RY3 ANYWAY?

Lester now an ally of Fae\*Dra asked politely: “Before we go, I’d like to inspect the cube and make sure its contents are safe.”

Fae\*Dra seemed to approve.

Lester pressed a button and a circle on thecube ejected a canister.  He twisted the canister and through a clear material glowed a floating sapphire gem perhaps 2 carrots in weight… it was a Tzo chrystal.

“A Tzo Chrystal?  Is this what you were saving” Lester asked Fae.

“I rescued IM-RY3”

“So you had no idea what was inside it?”

Fae didn’t seem surprised but Lester was dumbstruck,  “What… is… THIS\!?... What is this thing\!? A TZO CHRYSTAL\!  Where is… .where is my… WHAT HAVE YOU DONE ALEXANDER\!”

In anger he grabbed the crystal which caused an unwanted reaction ….. “AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\!”  he yelled and for Lester everything went black.

## CHAPTER THE WISH STONE

Lester was falling through a warm and humid atmosphere. He felt great.

He struggled to orient himself, but realized his reaction control suit wasn't operational \--no \-- he was naked. The naked situation bothered him more than the terminal velocity situation but then he discovered he was not completely naked just wearing a thin garment he had never seen before. And with that priority addressed he could move on to his lesser concern: being as flat as a pancake in the next few seconds.

Without equipment he had little hope unless the garment could be fashioned into a parashute..... nope... little more than covering his privates.... not enough material.

He fell through the cloud layer and could now see clearly the planet he was falling towards. He was headed to a cliffside by a lake and there were structures. Ruins. It was a precursor planet Lester had not seen before, of course he wasn't well studied on the various precursor sites. He did his best to make a survey of the land before his skeleton became a permanent monument .

Closer he approached. He still felt great for some reason... all worries blown away even the present and deadly one.

And then CRASH\! he hit the ground and created a giant crater. He wasn't instantly knocked unconscious which was a bummer, he thought he'd have to die slowly and he did a mental diagnostic of his body to see what was hurting what would give out first... and he found nothing. He was completely uninjured.

He stood and continued to observe. He walked out of the crater and saw a giant rock seemingly pushed to its side and on it appeared some petrified foot prints that were .... human\!? They had to be millions of years old, how could that be there were no humans then...

In front was a cluster of three thrones and some sort of bird bath all in remarkably good condition. He was facing them from behind and decided to go around to see them from the front.

Then a startle... someone was sitting on one of the lesser thrones\!

It was an old but beautiful looking woman. She seemed thinner than an average person but just as tall and had pointy ears like some kind of elf.

She stood and bowed gracefully "Lester Man" she said.

Tactical Engineers weren't used to people treating them with respect... As a matter of fact respect made Tactical Engineers suspicious. But this lady did have a lovely planet and given the novelty of the situation he was more amenable to giving her a chance…. At the moment Lester couldn’t make himself speak.

“I must speak the words and speak them rightly for we have but a little time in this now.”

“We are the Bringlings.  We are called the Bringlings for we are those who brought this universe into existence.  Some think us gods – although my master rejects such arrogance.  Know that we are of great power and our deeds of heroism are seared into the legend of this universe.  But with time we grew weary and lost the fortitude to defy evil.”

“Gods wish upon a mortal to set something straight in this universe by giving that mortal his power.”

“That is why my master summons you, Lester Mann.  You are her hero and you will make this universe right again or we will all die.”

A magical block on Lester’s voice seem to be lifted.

“But what do you want me to do?”, Lester asked

“More explanations will come, for now know that everything you have done and continue to do is and has been right… we know this because the wish stone chose you”

“In parting you must know some small things.  You face an enemy with power beyond what ou and your companion’s mind can comprehend and are in great peril.   For today: “Run, Run and keep on Running. As you do so you will grow stronger and we will imbue you with many bringling gifts when you are ready.  Run and Run and Run and then one day you won’t run anymore.”

Lester felt a disturbance… the experience was about to end.

“Gift? What gift will you give me? How can i use it?”

“Your first gift has already been given… I lack the time to tell you about it but you will start to feel its presence soon… soon you will be able to use it.

The experience began to shift... colors and sounds became like they were underwater and Lester started feeling light headed.

"But who are you?"

"Ah\! That I can tell you, Lester Mann.... My name is Meru and I am at your service.

The dream ends.

HUMANS TO BE CONTINUED….

BRINGLINGS FINAL

# The Bringling Day of Gifting

On an unnamed field of grass and poppies under the graceful soar of giant preybirds in the kingdom of Wuskia on the Planet Rheashan in the galaxy of the milky way under the Bringling empire and in the universe of resolution a young boy named DyAd practiced swordplay with the prisoner Zetsway guided by the royal knight Deebit.

It was the Bringling day of giving an important day for all things bringling. For all that is got by a bringling is from gifting. And of great importance new skills, spells and magical trinkets are passed as gifts but to be worthy of the best gifts one must first prove his proficiency. And this is why DyAd toiled to secure and prove his skill before the ceremony.

But DyAd was more than a boy... he was actually a boy and two girls and if that wasn't weird enough these merged siblings shared the same mind. Together they were referred to as the Regent Apparent, but individually their names were Tres, DyAd and Monoli Wusk. They shared one body and their appearance would instantly change to the one who was talking .

On some gifting day perhaps today–but likely not–one of the two girls would be the inheritor of the most valuable thing to all Bringlings. It was a gift for girls since Bringling society was matriarchal and the prize was called ‘*The fruit of the Previous life*.’ Controlling Fruit of the Previous life meant absolute rule of all things in the universe of Resolution or so that is what was thought. No one yet had learned how to wield it.

Dyad couldn't care less about the superprize; he just wanted to be a more powerful knight.

His sparing partner Zetsway was an indensured summon of Deebit meaning he could be called to appear at any time and fight. Zetsway was a prisoner of the Bringlings for millions of years still paying off a sentence for a crime only he actually knew.

What he looked like was anyone's guess since an iron mask covered his face also making it impossible for him to speak. Something like a chain metal straight jacket bound his arms behind his back... the chain main ran all the way down to his legs and bound them tightly together too. Finally heavy chains wrapped around his body from his neck to his ankles. From behind his iron mask two yellow and longing eyes told a different story to every individual who thought they saw something in him. Lastly it couldn't be missed that he was filthy ... the only skin that was visible was his unshod feet and it couldn't be determined if he was humanoid feet or not because of the filth.

The aforementioned description of Zetsway makes him seem rather impotent and at this moment he was, but one would be deceived to think that was always the case.... for apart from being able to summon Zetsway from thin air Deebit could also release his confinements one by one. But doing so was said to be dangerous for every encumbrance that was disabled Zetsway became incrementally stronger AND incrementally harder to control. His full power was not known and yet he was formidable even in fraction.

Today Zetsway was living the lowlife by being forced to allow DyAd to swing his sword attacks which Zetsway had been easily dodging all day. It seemed cruel, but DyAd at his level still could not hope to scratch the mysterious Zetsway and so the training went on.

"Now hold steady and gather energy into the blade.... swing\!" , Deebit guided.

"You can do it\!" chimed in Tres.

Upon conducting a downward spin a large disc of wave energy was released from DyAd’s sword and rolled through the air leading up to Zetsway, but missed its target for Zetsway had already side stepped.

"Again\!"

Another swipe and miss. This has been going on for a while.

"They will not give you super speed until you can accurately hit a target while you are NOT moving..." Deebit repeated in frustration.

Monoli sensed her brother's anguish, "Don't feel bad, you are getting closer each time\!" (this wasn't true at all)

"Your eyes are betraying you" the voice was familiar but no one knew where it came from.

"Oh god, where the hell are you this time..", Deebit asked

"Hi There." the man was standing high atop a tree watching with a birds eye view and he wasn’t alone… a tiny Whysan girl no older than 6 stood beside him.  Both disappeared in a puff of smoke and smoked in again behind Dyad… the Whysan girl poofed in nearby.

Dyad then transformed to Monoli "Teacher Modus\!" and she hugged him with great affection. Modus smiled.

"Let's give our DyAd another chance. With your permission, Ser Deebit?"

"Yes , granted... " Deebit sat in the grass clearly weary from teaching young DyAd.

Monoli transformed into DyAd again.

Modus whispered so Zetsway couldn't hear. "He's predicting your aim and strike because you have put all your training and gifts in the pursuit of powerful strikes... and indeed the power of your strikes are formidable... but predictability plus power negates formidablity for you will never land a blow on the opponent wise to your strategy.

Moreover you have no time to learn bending techniques before the gifting ceremony. But you are not yet lost.

To solve your little conundrum I have something for you on this day of gift giving...." Modus produced a small trinket, a loose bracelet with a heavy bobble on the end.

"Wear this and hold the bobble against the hilt with your swinging arm. Now swing as usual and release your energy disc wave."

He does so. The disc wave tumbles towards Zetsway who predictably leaps out of the way.

"Nothing changes" said Tres

"Now try again... this time after you release your disc wave and when it reaches half way to your target let go of the bobble.", Modus instructed

Dyad pulled back and released a fresh energy wave... he saw the moment Zetsway jumped out of its path and then released the bobble.... the disc wave's path then began to arc to the left hitting Zetsway square in the centerline causing a giant smokey explosion"

Dyad transformed into Tres: "Wow\! Unbelievable\!"

Deebit sat up in excitement.

The dust cleared and Zetsway seemed unharmed which was expected.

Tres transformed into Monoli who shouted the spell "Celebration" which caused all the poppies in the field to explode and release a vast confetti of flowers that jetted as high as the stratosphere… and it caused the little whysan girl–who lacked Modus’s skill and the protection of a bringling–caused the girl to be blown high into the sky.

As she fell to the ground Modus caught her… she was covered in flower confetti and having the laugh of her lifetime.

"Who gives you those silly spells"

"Uh..." she looked at teacher modus ... " I don't know.

The laughing girl ran to Monoli Wusk and both gave each other a knowing hug.

“I bind myself to you as your Whysan, my master, Monoli Wusk”

Monoli was overjoyed, “I accept your pledge and bind myself to you… you… what is your name Whysan?”

“Meru”, she said.
