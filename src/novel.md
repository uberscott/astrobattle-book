## CHAPTER 2 SLEEP DISTURBANCE

One hour after the annihilation of the Zell, the Red Destiny drifted peacefully.  Its main power source was literally fused into a molten mess, it could no longer defend or attack; It could barely move.  Auxiliary power supplied life support and minimal communication.

In the darkened bridge Alexander napped with his captain's seat fully reclined (another specialty of the Red Destiny \-- no other captain's seat in the fleet could recline.)  Fae interacted with her capsule in silence.

Their recent handiwork on the Zell fleet filled the entire vid screen.  The plasma field had cooled to a mass of super hot gas forming an opaque barrier between The Red Destiny and the Flotilla and Alliance Fleet.

Suddenly squawk on the comm channels signaled a much anticipated message for Alexander, “Slyther\! Have you found him\!?”

“Admiral Mudd cannot be found… most likely blown into space.  We continue to search but there is a lot of debris after the battle.”

“And Pete”

“Yes\! Pete is alive and recovering.  He was found unconscious but will be made completely well our medics predict”

Alexander reclined back in his chair, “What a relief.” He terminated the comm with Slyther.

A small detachment of the Ronin fleet had advanced beyond the Red Destiny pursuing the remnants of the Zell fleet.  Even though the principal elements of the Zell fleet been annihilated their rear guard, several reserve formations and support ships that lurked behind the flagship were unharmed by the Red Destiny's blast.  Victory for the Human fleet was assured, however, the Zell did not stop fighting and the Ronin fleet adopted cautious tactics in order to minimize casualties.  The Ronin Fleet faced another couple of hours of tedious slaughtering before the battle could end.

A communication came over the vid screen.  "Commander, we anticipate the mop up to last about two more hours.  Shall I have your ship towed back to the front line?"

"Negative. Commit all resources to the mop up we don’t want to endanger the men.  Retrieve us upon your victorious return.", Alexander didn't even open his eyes."

"Aye Aye sir\! And Great work\!"

Alexander's only response was a smile.

“Why for you won’t take a tow?  Men not in danger\!", Fae asked.  Lies completely confused her.  Lies from Alexander fascinated her and Alexander was accustomed to being questioned by Fae after he emitted the smallest of white lies.  He always took the time to explain to Fae in as much detail as she wanted.

"No. I just want to sleep. They can handle the rest."

Just then an unsettling thing happened.  A “red light” – or at least that is how best it could be described– passed through The Red Destiny and every other ship in the fleet.  Alexander and Fae could “Feel” the light cross them like some type of energy phasing by. The light wasn’t really red or a light but sort of a subtraction of light and yet also not a shadow.  It was quite simply impossible to explain and all who felt it shuttered.  But it seemed to have no effect so life quickly went on.

Alexander had followed up his victory with the usual transmission of a prepared message and a speech to the entire human race.  Just as his fleet would not relent against a broken enemy, Alexander sought to crush every last remnant of his political opposition.

*"I apologize for being so insistent.  I will never desire to oppose the will of the people.  But the polling my rivals conducted was a fraud and we still do not know the true wants of the people."*

*"You have witnessed the greatest military victory since humans first engaged in astro battle.   This victory was brought because of you, the people, the ones who have endured thirty years of Zell torment, the only ones left."*

*"What if I told you our nightmare could be over tomorrow?  That is right.  We can defeat the Zell. For just as humans regard the three remaining habitat spheres as the future of the human race; The Zell have only three planetary hatcheries that is their only future.  Years of scouting and analysis have revealed this to us."*

*"Presently we sit at a point equidistant from all three hatcheries.    We know the rivalries between Zell hatcheries run deep; deeper than their rivalry with humans.  The Zell, as predictable as ever, have abandoned their protective posts and rushed to destroy the humans, to claim the glory of victory for their hatchery."*

*"In another twenty hours the Zell fleets will reach a point of no return where they will not be able to turn back and defend their hatcheries if they are attacked.  Their precious hatcheries will be virtually undefended."*

*"For the rest of the plan, I ask you to have faith in me.  Trust in me as human-kind's humble protector for the moment.  I pledge to deliver victory.  I pledge to free you from the Zell Nightmare we have experienced for the last eight years.  I pledge to bring a new age where human kind will once again flourish."*

*He paused for a while.*

*"My opponents, the Representatives I speak of, put a question to you earlier today.  They asked in effect 'Do you believe humanity would be better served under our stewardship?'  They claim you have said yes.  But they are deceivers and the polling results are merely their latest concoction, the last lie they will ever tell.   Whatever the results they have asked the wrong question.  I put the question to you: 'Do you choose Eternal Retreat or Eternal Victory?'  I put this question to you this once, and will abide forever by your decision, as we will never have an opportunity again.  We will have a vote in one hour.  Choose the fate of humanity wisely."*

After he ended the transmission Fae asked, "Why polls so false?"

"I don't know.  It's how politics are done, I guess.", Alexander answered.  "Slyther will falsify the results of this vote if the legitimate results do not fall in my favor.", He then leaned back and started his nap.

The poll results started to flow in an hour into his nap.

"95% approval," Fae commented.

Alexander opened one eye to look at the polling results on his vid screen, "Savor the adoration of the people today.  Tomorrow we will start in our new roles of being the greatest mass murders in human history." He went back to sleep.

A short time passed and Fae became interested in some new instrument readings… She summoned multiple screens and started reviewing sensor logs.  The ambient sound in the bridge changed to the beeps and audio interactions of Faes computer interface.

The change in ambient sound alerted Alexander.  He opened the same one eye... as if that eye was less asleep than the other and he observed Fae for a moment.  He closed his eye and hoped Fae would sort out the matter without needing his involvement.

But Fae kept summoning screens and scrubbing through log data and it began to bother Alexander.

"What is it, Fae?", his eyes were still closed.

"Anomolous phenomenon."

"Good", Alexander thought.  Unexplained phenomenon was not his bag.  He allowed himself to start a descent into a deeper sleep.

Five minutes passed and Fae's confusion grew.

"Alexander?"

"Yes, Fae?" Alexander responded grogily.

"There is something in the cloud."

"Debris?"

"No. ship.  A Zell one."

Alexander sprung to a sitting position.

"Did it enter after the blast?", he asked.

"No contrail."

"Is it derelict?", Alexander hoped

"No. Energy signature,  accelerating and intentional maneuvering."

“Maneuvering where?”

“To Us.”

"What kind of ship is it?"

Fae ran some analysis for a few seconds and had an answer, "Dreadnought."

"The Dreadnaught?  The same flagship?"

"No.", Fae Reported, "It will get closer we can scan it…."

A couple of uncomfortable minutes passed. Alexander abandoned any hope of returning to his nap and inclined his captain's seat.  They waited in silence, there was no point in taking action until they understood what they were dealing with.

Five kilometers from the Red Destiny the gas cloud seemed to cough up the mystery object.  A large Zell ship emerged trailing swirls of gas that seemed reluctant to release its guest.

"It's the flagship.", Fae updated

"How? How could it have survived\!? It doesn't have a scratch\!"

"Negative.  Not the flagship we blasted. It is THE Zell Flagship.  The Eight Ball."

Zell battleships were not named by the Zell, but particularly scary or important Zell ships would earn a title among the humans.  "The Eight Ball" was the super flagship of the entire Zell race.  It superseded control of all three hatcheries and allowed the entire Zell race to act as one species.  No fleet had ever seen The Eight Ball in person and survived.

"Are there any more?" Alexander Asked

“No”

"Where is its fleet?", He asked to himself.

"Summon the Ronin fleet.  Abandon the mop up.  We have to destroy this ship."

The Eight Ball drifted forward and was heading directly for The Red Destiny.

"We are completely defenceless?"Alexander asked.

"Besides small arms, we have no defence"

"Can we escape?"

"We have enough power for maneuvering thrusters.  We can produce enough velocity to get out of the path of the Flagship, but if it steers towards us, we cannot escape it.",

"Contact my cavalry.  Command them to leave the Ronin fleet and come to our position at maximum speed...  And Remember this Fae, always consent to a tow when it is offered.  Always."

"I will remember not to lie."

Alexander nervously observed his tactical display watching The Eight Ball and his cavalry approach The Red Destiny. There was no way the Calvary could arrive in time.

At one-kilometer The Eight Ball came to a complete stop and did nothing.

"No Fleet, No Shields, No attack... what's their game?", Alexander pondered aloud.  "I sense a trap.  The Eight Ball would be a prize of a victory for our side without question. It's being dangled in front of me just as I dangled the Red Destiny in front of the Zell.  And If I was Zell, surely I would abandon my ship and attack.  But a trap is not needed.  We are the defenceless ones.  We are completely outmatched at the moment and our rescue cannot arrive in time to spare us if they attack now.  So what is their game?"

"Alexander\!", Fae said excitedly.  Her excitement was the clearest indication that she had discovered something very bad she summoned a large situational map of the entire theatre.

And then Reason and Reksep broke in on the comms: “We are surrounded.”

“The Red Destiny?”

“No, The entire Human Fleet is surrounded”

There were few times in his life that Alexander was stunned into complete inaction.  This was a moment.  Absolute horror swept through his body.

His inaction began to thaw and he started the process of discovery that would bring about victory, a process he had gone through many times but never inside what seemed such an impossible situation.

Alexander: "Estimated size of the Fleet?"

Reksep: "Uncountable. “They surround us from every angle in a spheroidal formation.”

Alexander experienced a second bout of petrification after Fae brought up a tactical view of the Zell fleets closing envelopment of the only remaining humans in the universe.

Again he struggled to find the right questions to get the victory discovery process started.  He decided to start with 'How.'

Alexander: "How could they have flanked us like this?  Do you think they can now cloak?"

Reason: "The vessels appear to be the same that were closing in on us before, the ones that had an arrival estimate of twenty to fourty-eight hours.  In an instant they have advanced to within one-half hour before they close."

Alexander: "Some kind of light distortion, they tricked our sensors to think they were far away?"

"Impossible." Fae said confidently.

Alexander thought for a moment.   "No\!  Fold technology\!?"

Alexander: “Fold Tech?”

Reksep: "I do not detect evidence of a fold, but it cannot rule it out."

Alexander: “Well, thanks… no way not knowing that isn’t going to lead to a strategic blunder…”

Reksep: "Fold systems consume massive amounts of energy.  Typically a fleet is bunched together and transferred in one giant fold bubble.  To surround us in an instant at trillions of positions far apart from each other would require a trillion fold systems and untold amounts of energy.  Am I right?"

Reason: "You are correct."

Alexander: "Are the Zell known to possess that much power?"

Reksep: "From our Analysis the Zell do not have enough energy to make a single fold."

Alexander: "Is there any evidence of the Eight Ball folding into the gas cloud?"

Reason: "Impossible.  We would know if it was a fold.  We registered energy from an unclassified phenomenon which was probably responsible for the appearance of The Eight Ball, but we have no better explanation of its sudden appearance other than 'it just appeared'."

Alexander: “Well that’s one thing.  At least we know they can’t fold.”

Reason: “Uhm, commander…. Its much worse… the Zell have a technology that we don’t understand that is far more dangerous than the fold system… they or some ally.”

Alexander thought to himself for a moment.  The 'how's' were getting him nowhere.  He changed his discovery tactics.

Alexander: "The Eight Ball.  If we decapitate the flagship it will throw the enemy into disarray.  Surely everything is being orchestrated from the Eight Ball... And the conditions to fight our final attack are met, the entire Zell fleet is here and the hatcheries are left unprotected.  How long will it take to jump the fold system?"

"One Half Hour," Fae Replied.

"Of course... initiate the fold systems, Fae.  Order the fleet to surround the habitat spheres in their assigned positions in preparation for all three folds.  Command our best attack forces, including the Calvary, to meet our position for a blitzreege attack on the Eight Ball. As soon as our attack commences reserve one cavalry ship to tow us to the Habitat-Sphere.", His confidence was only half restored, many unknowns confronted his plan.

"The Eight Ball is creating a spheroidal shield.  Two kilometers in diameter.  We are surrounded in it."

"More surprises from the Zell,"  He meditated for a moment.  "Cancel the attack on the Eight Ball. Summon a squadron of stealth ships to linger near our position and wait to tow us--maximum cloak. Prepare timed and event driven messages to send to all the players involved in the attack on the hatcheries.  Do not avail them to the entire plan at once, they won't have the stomach for it.", He paused, "I will board the Eight Ball and disable her shields."

Fae's Androsynth face showed a rarely seen surprise. She stood and faced Alexander.

He began prepping his armor for battle.  "I don't really need the cape, but it makes me feel more powerful", he said to himself.

"We are equipped with twelve warbots.  Prep all for battle, Six will accompany me and Six will stay to protect you and the Red Destiny.  Have my sword, shields and spear readied. Also prep a stealthy escape pod.  We will launch in a single line behind the escape pod, pointing towards The Eight Ball.  Hopefully the stealthy pod will make our arrival a surprise.", He continued to speak with half confidence.

Fae initiated all of Alexander's order with her mental connection to the Red Destiny.  Service bots began to scurry about the ship grabbing supplies, swords and taking warbots out of tight storage areas.  Fae looked on at Alexander, her eyebrows showed the slightest tension.

Alexander donned his helmet and began to descend a starboard side ladder that led to the forward escape hatch.

He stopped right where his chest eclipsed the floor and looked at Fae.

"Have a stealth pod ready for yourself as well.  At the first sign of trouble, eject in the pod and use the warbots as a distraction.  Wait for the all clear sign and then use your blades to requisition a tow.",

He looked at her face. Fae's eyes were swollen.  The number of tears shed by Androsynth throughout history could not fill a thimble.  Alexander recognized it for the important moment that it was. He hustled back up the latter, removed his helmet and approached Fae. She looked down. She was very slightly trembling.

"I go with you.  I am stronger.", Fae said.

His gentle tone contrasted the many powerful heart stopping speeches he had given that day.  "Fae, My best friend, as comrades we have accomplished much together and I do not believe our collaboration is meant to end today.  Still I admit--this fight has me worried.  But in every impossible situation an opportunity waits to be discovered.  Just as our defeat to Mudd seemed imminent, we discovered our salvation waiting to be plucked and turn our despair to victory \-- That situation seems like child's play right now, like it was a lesson we learned in another age, an obstacle we could counter without effort now."

"The Eight Ball has issued a challenge.  It's me they want.  If I don't go they will attack The Red Destiny and both of us will be lost for sure.  I have to go and go alone--it's our best chance to bring about a victory."

"I ask you to stay with the Red Destiny and preserve your life no matter what happens.  I ask you to abstain from observing this fight save for monitoring my vital signs as anything more will tempt you into rash action.  I ask you to complete our fight for the human race till the very end \-- it will not be much longer now.  I ask you to wait for the opportunity to present itself-- I cannot tell you what it will be as I don't know myself-- but you will know it when you encounter it.  If you do those things for me I am sure to return to your side.", he gently cupped her cheek with his hand.

A moment passed.  Alexander disengaged Fae, donned his helmet again and ambled down the latter in silence.

He opened the hatch and immediately was tractored out of the ship falling down, down, down to the evil Zell ship below.

CHAPTER BATTLE ARENA 8BALL  
Alexander woke in darkness.  He carefully stood and gathered his brains.  He diagnosed his body and felt no injury.  His armor was on and functional… his weapons and warbots companions were nearby.

The light improved and he realized he was on the surface of a giant floor… a giant giant cavernous part of the ship… with viewing stands.  It was a battle arena\!

The light improved more and both he and the Zell could see each other… the Zell let out a giant howls for their human hero.

And on the other side of the Arena a Zell brute entered through a giant door.

Alexander: “Summon Spear”  his spear lept off the ground and into his hand.   The Brute began to charge towards him.  Alexander pointed his spear at the Brute and said “seek & boost”  flame emitted from the back of the spear and it perforated the charging Brute right through.  The spear lodged in the arena wall and the Brute fell over dead.

The violence was well received by the Zell peanut gallery\!

Alexander sought an opportunity to talk to his hosts, but playtime wasn’t over he supposed and when it comes to the Zell playtime is slaytime.

An overzealous Zell jumped from the elite section into the arena–probably out of turn.  He was slightly larger than the average Zell warrior.  He was clad in an armor that merely protected his most vulnerable parts. Yellow warpaint covered his body and the armor. Two horns protruded from his back in a curved shape making a 'U' formation.  The horns had an uneven surface and ended not in a point, but in a dull rounded fashion.  They looked a bit like coral reef of ancient earth in texture and shape.  The horns were purely ornamental.  Upon both front hands a blade revealing a one handed sythe protruded.  Like most Zell, he walked on all fours, but the sythe weapons were pointed slightly upwards so as not to interfere with his walking.

The new customer walked in front of the dead brute and stood on his hind legs.

Alexander couldn't let a good sucker punch opportunity get away.  He swung his sword from above his head to the floor and released a sharp yellow crescent that hit the unsuspecting Zell enemy off guard.  The Zell was pushed back by the energy crescent, but he did not fall down, and his armor and hide remained unbroken.  The only evidence of the attack was a minor indentation running from his head to the base of his legs and some of his warpaint was blasted off.

"Your above average.", Alexander said

Alexander attacked again swiping his sword in a cross pattern that resembled an 'x'.  It was a more powerful attack, sending two slicing crescent simultaneously.  When performed by an expert the first crescent travelled modestly slower than the second, allowing both to combine the moment they reached the target.

His Zell opponent opened his mouth wide and a chaotic spatial distortion geometry appeared only two feet in front of him.  The slicing crescents struck the spatial distortion geometry and their energy was distributed in every direction some portion damaged the intended target.

Bolts flew from the Zell's mouth in rapid succession.  Alexander summoned his shield to block the bolts, and began a clockwise run around his opponent.  The bolts were noticeably stronger than anything he had experienced before and the shield struggled to hold. When the bolt attack subsided Alexander jetted towards the Zell and brought down a mighty blow of glowing yellow sword from above.  The Zell blocked with his right forearm armor, and a loud sound of metal clashing echoed throughout the cavernous room.  It was Alexander's strongest attack and did no more than add a minor dent to a piece of equipment that was clearly not new to battle.

Rapidly the Zell swiped his left Sythe towards Alexander's undefended midsection.  Alexander ignited his sword's retro thrusters sliding on his boots to a ten meter distance between him and the Zell.  A trail of red human blood seemed to connect the two warriors.  If he had reacted a moment later he would be in two pieces right now.  The Sythe now glowed with green energy. Alexander's blood sizzled on the blade.  He had a shallow horizontal cut spanning the length of his stomach.

Alexander's long shield zoomed in to bash the Zell.  The Zell was not pushed back, but he had caught the shield in his jaws.  With great effort he bit down on the shield and crushed it.  The shield could repulse the most powerful attacks, but was not designed to be vertically compressed.

He spit out the shield.  "Scum\!", the Zell said. "You die human\!",  The gallery approved of the poorly scripted dialog with rousing cheers.

"You ARE above average.   I have faced many Zell, none stronger than you.", He was stalling a bit for his numbing meds to mask the pain coming from his stomach.  “I’m so impressed I can’t wait to have you stuffed for my plunder room” Alexander added that to please the fans while he weaved in important talk… talk being the only thing that could save him from this situation.

"Tell me Zell, we humans have often wondered, 'why do you fight us?'"

Gra’all seemed perplexed.  He spoke slowly and calmly, “We made to kill humans. Humans made to kill us? Zell and Humans best friend.  Fight for fun.  When all humans die, Zell die too.”

“Ok” Alexander said…. He was a little taken aback that the human race faced extinction because of this absolute stupidity.

“And … yep, we love you too, Zell…. Do you think there is another way we could have fun together.  Seems sad it will all be over if one of us wins… maybe we can keep on playing.

“Welll, we like just kill you because You the greatest Man.  We kill the Greatest Man. We win. But then they make us kill the others too before we die. Less fun but better than build society or something… so bore.”

Alexander did not expect Gra’al’s answer.  Had the Zell been engineered to destroy the human race?  That would imply another entity that was the true enemy of humanity.

Alexander looked to the gallery.   “Who here speaks for all of the Zell\!  I request counsel\!”  But he was ignored.  As a matter of fact his flat words didn’t go over well in his fan base.  He caught himself and said “I wanna talk about Lets talk about turning this arena into a grinder and grinding all the zell to bits for a laugh.”  …. Audience recovered.

Alexander discovered there was something of an elite booth amongst all the rabble.  It was shaded and unclear what was really happening.  Behind he saw tree figures… in shadow. One was a tiny humanoid-like but frail and floating in a bubble of liquid without a tank of any sort.

The next was something of a robot…. It looked like a weird salt shaker with the top and bottom being symmetric with 3 thin legs and 3 thin arms.

And the fourth was a giant humanoid… probably  2.5 to 3 meters tall and covered in a cloak.  Alexander could barely make out this creature’s body–and the face was shrouded in sorcery  but his feet were exposed and they seemed exactly as a human foot would look like.  The cloak seemed to flow and wasn’t from fabric but some sort of energy.

In each case the creatures shared eyes of the dark hue. the same hue that Alexander felt earlier in the Destiny…. It was a color that subtracted rather than added yet that it was there was strongly felt.

Each of these three creatures seemed to have some sort of crown that hovered above their heads and followed them wherever they went.  The crown looked like some kind of rock and each was set a crystal glowing with the dark hue.

He appealed to Gra’al to get the identities of the 3: "Who tells you? Who is your master?", Alexander asked.

Gra’al shrugged…. The fight would have to continue soon.

He returned to scanning his enemy for a weakness.  He was settling on an unarmored section near Gra’al’s right arm pit.

The crowd started jeering.  If they didn't get back to fighting soon the entire stadium of Zell would rush onto the battlefield and kill both of the contestants in anger.

“Death is our master, Alexander”  the tall creature said. “Now kill him Gra’al”

Gra’al leapt towards Alexander. The crowd's attitude flipped immediately making approving noises for the latest spectacle.

Gra’al sailed in a Ten meter arc and brought down both Sythes upon Alexander's freshly vacated position, Alexander dodged the attack by one meter. Gra’al’s attack impacted the floor causing a shock wave and leaving a small crater behind.

Quick attacks from Gra’alls followed and Alexander did nothing but Perry.  The attacks were still strong without a jet assist from his sword Alexander would not be able to block his opponent at all.

They separated again, and Gra'al opened his mouth wide.  A spherical pool of green energy began to coalesce in front of this gaping mouth.  He put his scythes in the sphere and they absorbed the energy readily.  This next attack would be strong.

Alexander prepared his defence stance.  This was the moment he would defend with all his strength and the moment the attack began to subside his pre programmed sword would jet directly into Gra’al’s weakest point.

The Sword had one unique defence mechanism.  It was a blocking technique enabled by the adamant engine.  Similar to the exceed engine, which could temporarily nullify the mass of an object and allow it to displace itself at lightning speed, the Adamant engine worked by increasing the effect of mass of an object without increasing its weight.  When the adamant engine was engaged it took great power to move even an inch yet could still be held in place by the wielder.

The attack commenced.  Gra’als leapt in his traditional fashion and brought down both scythes towards his opposition's head.

Alexander positioned his sword horizontally right in the path of the concave side of the Sythes.  A great shock wave occurred when they met.  The power of Gra'al’s attack transferred through Alexander's armor and created a new crater. The adamant engine engaged in the nick of time and held the sythes at bay.  The weapons contradicted each other as Gra'al used every bit of his might to cut through Alexander's sword.  The sword edge emitted the brightest yellow energy. At the point of contact sparks

And Alexander's power was fading.  The power in his sword was diminishing and fatigue began to set into Alexander's body.  The two fighters looked into each other's eyes.  Gra'al pushed his mouth forward to get close enough to bite, but it was futile.  Alexander wished he had brought a dagger he could plunge into the vulnerable stop while he was protected by his blocking shield.

The powerful attack had been mostly spent and Gra'al began to withdraw for a new strike.  That was the moment.  Alexander triggered his sword to disengage the adamant engine, turn and jet directly into the left shoulder of his nemesis.  The sword penetrated into Gra'al body, but stopped at about three inches.  The blade did not pass the carapace layer and was another two inches from slicing into actual flesh.  Gra'al had grabbed the sword with his left hand and held it.

Alexander initiated an overload buildup in his sword.  He wouldn't get to deliver a detonation to Gra'al innards, but his outer layer of carapace would be blown off, leaving him vulnerable to an attack as weak as a fingernail scratch.

But in his enthusiasm to end his foe, Alexander had disregarded his defence.  Gra'al plunged his right hand sythe deep into Alexander's lower chest, piercing all the way through his body.  He lifted him off the floor and Alexander's body limped like a puppet that had its strings cut.  Gra'al cast him away several feet; Alexander landed on his back and slid for a few feet.

The crowd went absolutely wild.

Alexander's left lung had been pierced. His breathing was now labored.  His armor could not keep him in fighting condition with this new injury and the armor itself was greatly damaged.  Blood had spilled out of Alexander's mouth covering his internal visor.  He struggled to take off his helmet.  His head was revealed and he gasped for air.

The sword exploded knocking Gra'al on his back.  His shoulder section was completely exposed and green Zell blood flowed from his wound.  Gra'al laid motionless.

Alexander herd the explosion but was too exhausted to lift his head.   In his dazed state he did not entertain any pessimism, for example, he did not worry if the mission might fail. He was euphoric at the moment.

Tears streamed from the corner of his eyes over the sides of his face.  He looked up at the lights and imagined he was viewing the stars in the heavens. He gave into a delusion to himself that he had done it.  He had saved the human race.  He smiled and coughed up more blood.

And in the picturesque view of the heavens a face slowly crept in from below.  It was Gra'al.  He had survived the blast.  Dispair enveloped Alexander immediately.

Gra'al grabbed Alexander by the arms and legs and held him high.

"THIS IS THE GREATEST MAN\!", he shouted.  Predictably An Uproarious clamour of excitement hit a peak.

Gra'al lowered Alexander and held him by his shoulders and touched his feet to the ground... it was the only way Alexander could stand at this point.  His head was pointed downward and he struggled for air.

"How you want die, Great Man?", Gra'al asked politely.

“drop him.", a powerful voice said.  Gra'al immediately obeyed and dropped Alexander back into his previous position, on his back looking at the sky.

The humanoid figure was approaching.

Some complaining noises started to hum from the gallery.  The onlookers could not tolerate a momentary interruption of pure violence.

"shut up.", The figure said.

The noise continued.

"SHUT UP\!" The figure yelled, and from his right hand a bright magenta ribbon of energy surged outwards, he wielded it like a whip and brought it about in a circular pattern over his head.  Anywhere the ribbon touched, or anywhere even near the ribbon exploded.  of the twenty-eight thousand Zell watching, only about three thousand survived the whip.  The limbs and guts from the unlucky ones rained into the fighting arena.  The elite section remained untouched.

Gra'al backed away.  In a very un-Zell-like way he was afraid of the cloaked figure.

Alexander lay on the floor; he was now struggling to take deep breaths with his one good lung. He would inhale and hold it in for a few seconds then exhale.  The very weight of his own chest would suffocate him in a short while.

The figure came into view just as Gra'al had earlier.  Above his head floated something difficult to describe.  It was about six inches in diameter; spheroidal save for three fat and short protruding elements that pointed in three opposing directions;  It was made of smooth, black stone except for the very center of the front portion where a glowing 'something' resided. The glow of the dark hue.

The dark figure spoke in deep and gruff tones.  "You fool.  You endangered us all.  The reckless ambition of one man nearly killed the entire human race forever.”

Alexander could not retort in his current condition.

“I have hated you for years. I have contested you from the shadows and now I spit on you as you die."

"I want you to know that the fold systems will not work as you expect.  I saw to that myself. I want you to know The Ronin fleet will be obliterated to the last atom as there is no chance for escape.  I want you to know that there is no way you can defeat this enemy, no amount of hubris or luck can possibly harm your true enemy for they have power beyond your imagination."

Alexander filled his lung with air to speak but nothing came out… he returned to his futile task of recovering his breath to live a few more seconds.

"It may comfort you to know that the human race will live on, but they will never be free again.  Of course you have put your own ambition before your race time and again, and as you die I'm sure you feel no different."

The dark figure lightly stepped on Alexander's chest as he was trying to inhale one of his deep breaths.

"I want you to know who did this to you.  I want you to see who you underestimated.  I want you to see your better."  The figure gently removed his mask.

A glimmer of recognition twinkled in Alexander's eyes.

“Yes.  I beat you. Now, die, you scourge of humanity\!"

The figured stepped hard on Alexander's chest. Air rushed out his mouth. He twitched a little as he tried his best to take another breath, but he would never inhale again.

He crushed the last bit of life out of Alexander's body with his foot.

\*\*\*\*

In space, several kilometers away from the Red Destiny, Fae sat in the stealthy escape pod in a fetal position.  She had obeyed Alexander's command and had not observed any part of the battle.  She stared at a single readout.  It was Alexander's pulse.  It blipped more and more softly and then flatlined.

And thimbles worth of Androsynth tears floated through the pod.

THE BRINGLINGS PART 1 CONTINUED

CHAPTER 5

“Trina\! Trinadon\!”  Deebit shouted for his new friend.

She seemed in danger having fallen deep into the cave structure then  
triggering a cave in. It was dark, she was underwater a shallow pool of water  
and a boulder the size of her body pinned her to the bottom.

But such a predicament was nothing for a Bringing of any stripe as they are always imbued with many protection magics. Her flesh could not be pierced bruised, burned or  
bludgeoned by anything but a bringling weapon or spell and neither of those  
seemed in any supply in this current darkness and pit of despair.

"Breath," she said. And the water became breathable. "See" she said and her eyes  
pierced all darkness. "Strength" she said and with no effort she tossed the  
bolder aside.

She stood out of the water and discovered a rocky and windy cave path. Flanked by a fertility totem. Such things had been less interesting than slugs a moment ago but this totem seemed to grab her guts and stir the first inklings of womanhood within her.

"Trina" (Deebit now spoke in a psychic connection) Are you ok? He asked  
She noticed she had lost some blood. Impossible\!  
"I live" she replied tersely"  
"I'm coming down"  
"Don't." I think this is a place only for women.  
"I don't know what to do\!" Deebit said aloud  
"No man does" This struck Deebit funny.... it was the first time she hadn't  
spoken to him like an agemate.  
"I will find the Whysan Modus"  
"Yes.... do that thing. In the meantime I am fine."    
Who is Modus? She thought…

Compulsion swelled in her and she walked the path of the totem. It was not a  
long path, but it was windy and with lots of artifacts... it was an ancient place  
She surmised.... not seen since the time of Rhea.  She came across an ornate glassy cap for– some exotic and ancient container.

Drops of blood came from Trina.... from the fall? impossible. It was a very  
A confusing thing. She swiped a sample with her finger and marveled at the  
beautiful crimson color. She had never bled before or seen any Bringling  
bleed.  
The blood sprang from her crotch and in checking she could find no obvious  
sign of injury. The sensation was scary and yet right to her so she persisted  
on the path.

Around the corner the journey ended and revealed a steamy grotto flanked by  
flowers and beautiful fauna it was a place for things to grow..... from the water  
refreshing steam billowed and filled the room with a warm delightful humidity.

Then she looked at herself in shame.... blood covered her dress from the  
midline down. Several spells failed to rectify her bloody clothes and the  
The position and magnitude of the blood seemed like it would embarrass her...

She waded into the grotto and started scrubbing her skirt like some primitive  
tribe girl. The blood washed quite effectively, but started to cloud that part of  
the water red.... a red that no seeing spell could pierce so she ventured deeper  
into the water. More washing and deeper still she reached the beam of light  
coming from the ceiling. with her task almost done she stepped in something  
that lit within her a burning want.... the want burned indeed but what she  
wanted was unclear.

She reached down to her foot and pulled from its perch a handful of bright  
brown clay the likes she had never seen before. It felt better than anything  
she had ever touched and she began to knead and work the clay  
She grabbled another handful and another and then sat on a nearby rock to  
work on her new obsession.

"We cannot find you, Trina\! What bewitrary is this\!" Her concerned friend  
called to her through his mind, but Trina was now completely obsessed with  
her task though she could not have told anyone WHAT she was doing. With a skill she didn't know she had, a figure began to take shape. It was a little  
person, but the proportions were all wrong. A big head. Stubby arms and legs  
and a fat little belly. Eyes larger than they should be, and shut.... a nose like a  
little button and cheeks that she wanted to take a bite from.

Then it was finished.

Trina looked at the thing she had created and joyfully wept. And these  
feelings confused her.... to love something more deeply and more completely  
than the slug she had caught just hours ago seemed impossible.

Then a shutter. Something was watching her... something with yellow eyes. She recoiled.  
"SIGHT\!" she commanded but there was nothing there.  
"Trina\!" she heard over the psychic waves.  
She swattled her new creation not knowing what to do with it only that she  
would now protect it with her life.

She looked up to the ceiling light and said "Ascend" and gravity released its  
hold on her and she began to float to the crevice in the ceiling. As she  
approached she noticed it was the light of Kardia... the third moon shown its  
light into the grotto. She had before always seen Kardia as an illformed  
potato of a celestial body, but it now seemed more like a floating and beating  
Heart.

She floated from the cave and hovered 10 meters into the moonlight cradling  
her clay thing.

"Its you\!" a figure riding a gondola came zooming to her position. "Float" he  
exclaimed and leapt from the gondola to take Trina into his arms.... she allowed him to  
hug her but used one hand to protect the bundle in her other arm from being  
crushed. I searched for you, I was worried.. "Here is your slug"  
Trina was content in his embrace. "Keep the slugfor me for a while. I have  
something far more important."  
"Something you found? "  
"Something I found. Something I made. I could not have without you"  
"But... you are bleeding\! He noticed her torn skirt.  
"Not anymore I'm not. It was scary, painful and beautiful. I have never felt such  
A thing as this moment."  
Deebit guided his crazed friend to the gondola. We have to get you back. You  
need to see a doctor.

CHAPTER 6  FROM CLAY TO STONE TO FLESH

On the eve of the great conjunction many things were already coming together.  
For one thing all the various couples living in the various huts near the nine  
steps of Rhea performed the ancient love act prolifically. It was a vestigial act  
but still fun.

Then the night gave to first dawn when the Marshal moon eclipsed the horizon  
and ignited itself with volcanic activity. The crowd cheered as fire and rock  
spewed forth from millions of kilometers away. The moon became even  
brighter as the deserts and valleys of the planet slowly became oceans of lava  
and lakes of fire.

The first sign that this was the day of fertility had presented itself  
The ceremonies would soon begin. A large and excited crowd gathered on a  
grassy nole across the lake from the nine steps. Bringlings not present to  
procreate per ce still enjoyed the party as they wined and dined on picnic  
blãnkets. Whysan servants used their magic to fulfill every Bringling desire and  
banish any scarcity of enjoyment.

Amongst the premium cabanas on the grassy nole it seemed some had still  
not completed the love act portion of the ceremony or perhaps they were  
being extra careful to follow the traditions.

Atop the hill of the nine steps was perched Rhea's throne. Marble and  
magnificent it had laid empty since the 2nd war of the Gud. And this chair was  
what the actual highly contested prize. If the moonline shone on a baby girl on  
This day SHE would be the new ruler of the Bringlings... she would be destined  
to inherit Rhea's power and delima, bring the 3rd and final Gudling war and end this world  
of Resolution so all may return to paradise.

But in the long years Bringlings waited for a successor there was a little  
conflict over those who sat on the flanking thrones those being for the king  
and queen regents.... the ones who ruled as they waited for Rhea's heir.  Presently Vallus and Regina Kastron assumed that power.

A new light pierced the skyline and that was the light of (2nd mood). Her light  
was made from radioactive crystals that glowed a bright blue on this day alone.  
The crowds cheered as this meant the ceremony could now begin. Maids cast off their clothes and gave their final affections to their lovers and then started to wade into the water  
grasping for the clay of life. Most took a while for spells did not work in this  
water.... one found it right away and shouted "Destiny"  The others did not like  
this and hastened their search.

From the 3rd hemisphere Kartia heaved from its slumber and began its fast  
travel towards its destiny with her sisters. Her fiery facade now just a glowing  
ember of green during the time of the festival she actually emitted less light.  
More cheering occurred as this meant the great conjunction was on hand.

All the maids had found adequate patches of clay and they worked furiously to  
mold them into babies. Some fared better.... others had hands fall off and their  
work sometimes just turned to mush.... if the process didn't flow the little one  
usually simply reverted back to regular clay and fell into the lake to be molded  
another day breaking the heart of the maid by in a way saying "Try again next  
Year"

Then a klaxon from the heavens rang out and all molding stopped.

The maids held their creations to the sky and a great pulse of energy came  
from the two moons bathing all in an additive light that is hard to understand. And when they brought their hands down from on high they no longer held clay but stone babies.

Trina fell to the ground. "What's wrong?" Dextrus asked.... Terrified she  
reached for her treasure .... it was not soft anymore but it was there.... hardened  
to stone just like the rest she witnessed. She now understood how Bringlings  
reproduce for the first time. Or at least how statues were made.

Maids left the waters and ran to their lovers and husbands. After sharing  
affections the maid would gently hand the new statue to her mate and he  
would sit on a stone and ponder the idol for some time. Often looking at the  
Dawny sky for inspiration.

On the paradise of Rheashashan much meaning came from the heavens. Because  
Kardia was not fully lit and the other moons were not bright enough every  
celestial body in the night sky was visible and to the Bringlings each star,  
comet and constellation represented a different virtue.

Trina's attention darted from man to man. She listened at great distance  
using a tele-auditory spell... technically not allowed but her curiosity was her master  
at this moment.

In each case the father would wait for the stone baby’s eyes to open.

Then each would speak unique words.

"You will take from me my virtue of strength and you will protect the things of  
our family.... I tell you to follow Hagi the star of they honest and you will serve  
your fellow bringling ... Wander, my lad. for we are of zathos the comet god and  
are destined to discover all the wonders of this great universe and one day  
perhaps also that of the previous life..

Each man in turn told the stone baby what to take from him, which celestial  
virtues to follow and how to live his life then the life giving moment would  
Come.

Then the babies eyes would close and their mouths would open.

Each man would deeply inhale and softly breath and kiss the lips of his baby and gently inhale into the  stone orifice.

The object would change from the statue and the earthen tones would fade to flesh tones .... more breath and more and the stone would begin to soften and make little twitching  
movements. Now soft and fleshy the man would kiss the tiny lips of the baby  
and insert the tiniest of breaths.... the lungs would fill and the baby came to  
life.... he withdrew his kiss and then handed a crying, moving and living baby to  
his mate.

Wails of joy could be heard all over the ceremony grounds. A new generation  
now made its way in this universe and the Bringlings continued themselves.  
Trina panicked. She realized the stone likeness in her satchel would stay  
that way if she didn't find a man to bring it to life. “Just when I finally thought they were useless” She thought.

In the stupidity of her panic she ran through the grounds looking for a man.... she fixated on one gentleman without a baby but was scared away by the painful looks of one of the woman  
who had just experienced a disastrous clay miscarriage.

On she ran. feeling the hardened body of her baby bouncing in her satchel...  
then... something felt wrong.... the shape was wrong... in full view of the festival  
she withdrew it in a panic and all who saw gasped\! It was not a  
baby but a sphere three baby faces.

A silent unease passed.

Then one man carefully said what all though, "Abomination" And this one word  
triggered the crowd into a frenzy. Women screamed and men approached  
aggressively as if to take and smash her statue.

She put it back in her bag and turned to run but a stranger grabbed her by the  
arm and more surrounded her. With a craze in their eyes men rumbaged  
through her bag and women began beating her and pulling her hair. One man  
finally took the bag and he and others ripped it to shreds and there was  
nothing inside.

"What sorcery is this?" "Seek\!" he proclaimed and he and all around were  
given super human sight for a moment... the world they saw looked blue and  
plain except for the thing they sought which to them shown as a blindingly red  
light. It sat there on a persons hand ... being held quite gently by a Whysan  
wearing a black coat with medium length flaxen hair squatting as if out of  
danger.

"There\! He has it\! Give us the idol", Whysan

"I don't think I will. I don't think you people will make very good parents"

Bringlings didn't like being spoken to like that from a mere Whysan and his  
words only served to increase their craze.

"Now come here girl. I know just how to save your baby"

"I can't get away, he has my arm"

"but you have his hand", Trina and the arresting man both looked down where  
he 'held' her and gasped. True he had her arm in his hand, but his hand was  
now cleanly cut off. He wailed and backed into the angry bunch now only  
concerned for his own health.

Trina made a run for it.  Modus joined.

"I was worried about this." They ran together as throngs of more Bringlings  
joined the mob.

"The pit you fell into is a forbidden fertility pit of Rhea... usually it makes  
things go wrong but maybe I can help you. Will you let me help you?"

"But the crowd", they will kill us"

"I can handle them..." Modus stopped... they had about 5 seconds of lead over  
the naked throngs trying to chew them up. "You want this? He held the stone  
head as high as his arm allowed... HERE\!" He threw the head up in the air with  
full force. it flew so high that it had to have been magically assisted.  
The mob surrounded but did not harass the escapees any further. Their  
attention was focused completely in the air, waiting for the three head to fall so  
they could destroy it.

“Close your eyes”, Modus said to Trina

Trina screamed and mashed her eyes shut.

In darkness: "I said I can help you... I still can, but I want something. Can you give me  
Something?"

The head exploded in such a bright combustion that the uplooking crowd  
became temporarily blinded and groped for counter spells to heal their eyes.

"Yes, anything...." she wept.

“You can open them now”, Modus said.

“Ok” she said.

“And then there is my wish.  Let me be bound to you as your Whysan advisor.  Grant me this bond for you know I will always protect that which is bound to me. I am both capable  
and determined more than anyone in this universe or the previous universe. And as you know it is impossible for a Whysan to betray that bringling to which  
he is bound.

Trina felt safe with this amazing whysan, " I agree" she said ....

Great\!  now this baby is a trimind and requires a binding unction to save.  The Kastrons are the only family on this planet that might have such a thing… but they will want the baby.  You will have to marry Gomert Kastron.

She crossed her eyes: “Ok”

At that moment thousands of heads identical to Trina's stone baby began to rain from the sky, rolling on the ground, plumping in the mud disappearing in  
the tall grass and sometimes conking people in the head.  
The crowd began to crawl on the ground seeking these decoys and destroying  
as many as they could as soon as they could all while modus took Trina's  
hand and made a run for it down a beaten path.

Looking back Modus laughed as a still blinded man grabbed one of the spheres and attempted to smash it over another bald man’s head thinking it to be another stone

"But you destroyed it" She said

"Destroyed what?" As he pulled her at top speed with his left hand The whysan  
held out his right hand and without looking the baby head sailed right into his Palm.

He then tore part of Trina's dress from a place that wouldn't compromise  
modesty and wrapped the artifact in cloth and handed it back.

### CHAPTER 7

Modus crashed the gondola through Deebit's prison window.

Trina screamed.

The Gondola began to dissolve into smoke, revealing a disheveled Deebit

Deebit was flustered but  blushed when he saw Trina.

"You have come to rescue me?" He asked.

"No, but I need you... and she needs you. Deebit loyal servant of the Kastrons... Do not ask questions for our time is little."

Modus, from his coat produced a mask and handed it to Deebit. "Wear this.  
The guards and staff will not make notice of you so long as you don't speak or  
touch anything but her.

“Take Trina to the thrown room and have her petition Vallus, master of the Kastron family for council.

“Deebit must NOT speak at this time for any reason. Kastron will refuse any request, but don't overdo it, Trina. You will be there to buy time until Kastron's bound Whysan Advisor Bey arrives. I will have spoken to him by that time and made him believe that your child is something the Kastrons must have.

"Baby" Deebit looked at Trina.

"Don't speak or think, Deebit." Modus reminded. "Just show her the way and act  
as her anonymous escort.

Modus opened the cell door without force or key.

"How?", said Deebit.

"Deebit, really, if anyone else is in the room and you talk again the illusion will  
break and they will run you through. And if you try to think again I'll run you  
Through."

Guards were frantically approaching.

Now for some more smoke. Modus exhaled a torrent of thick black smoke. The  
shade made nothing visible. "The Eyes of Modus" Modus commanded and all three  
escapees could see through the smoke like it was no more than a darkened  
haze. They ran past three sets of confused guards shouting "Eyes\! Eyes\! the  
Eyes\!" but Modus' enchantment was too strong for their weak magic.  
"Fulfill your mission kids. I will meet you in the throne room AND don't drop  
that baby\!"

The great conjunction was nearly upon this world and all in the house of the  
Kastrons lingered on the balcony waiting to see the celestial artistry of Rhea  
Unfold.

Villus Kastron addressed his family, "She really was quite the artist our  
Ancestor"

Lady Roleta his wife added: someday a Kastron descendant will be born from  
this land and create works and worlds the likes even the previous life would be  
in awe to witness."

"Well, its not going to be Urka or Aylia's year to produce an heir what with what  
Deebit did with their hair and clothes.

Roleta asked, what do you think of that, my son? Could it be you?  Could you be the heir? Technically luna can select any child born during a lesser conjunction so long as it was not before a previous conjunction"

Vallus, “That’s somewhat of a stretch of the rules… who knows”

Gomert relished the praise from his parents. "I will be the greatest artists of  
any universe one day.... I will make the first super rift between worlds, a planet  
rich in oriculoum--"

Some inappropriate noise from the direction of the thrown room bothered  
them a little.

"I want to make the first planetary ecosystem where each species comes from  
a different pla--"

More disturbance.

Gomert annoyed: "Whysan what is this commotion?

A flustered Whysan servant entered and reported: "A commoner and her whysan escort  
wish to speak to the Lord”

"At this time\!" Villus snarked, "The conjunction is about to happen.... we could  
have a new queen"

At that instance two door guards were parted. They fell to the ground and their  
mighty halyards crashed and clanged. Villus spit out his wine. Gomert pissed  
his pants \-- the conjunction party was officially ruined by this final event.  
But the ruiner was Chief advisor Bey.... Villus's whysan companion, respected  
by all in the house of Kastron. If he felt the need to do some guard tipping  
people thought there must be a good reason and there was.  
My lord, I speak quickly for opportunity and time.

I will explain and you must decide quickly: Outside I have discovered an  
extraordinary woman. She has modeled a living stone baby from the forbidden  
clay. And moreover this baby is a trimind.   
I needed remind you of the  
greatness of the last Bringling duomind who still changes our world to this day.

The baby lacks paternal breath and the mother is mateless and unmarried.

I do not deceive in saying that a trimind in the Kastron family would surely give  
you the throne of Rhea you so desire. I also cannot deceive in saying that  
breathing life into a trimind is tricky and the child may die either way.  But we are not completely out of our depth… for our alchemist has recreated the unction of binding…. The same unction that saved the infant lives of Calcus and Kashic, the two greatest minds of this Bringling universe.

So here it is:  Make this woman a Kastron.  Mary her to your son Gomert.   
Give this stone orb your family's breath and make it into your grand child. The child will be the greatest asset to the Kastron name if not the Rhea’s successor herself”

Deebit fidgeted with his mask, but said nothing. The masks enchantment made  
him seem an uninteresting commoner that wasn't worth looking at.... but the  
slightest attention would break the illusion.

The conjunction ticked ever so closer... time was almost up.

There you have it my lord.  Choose wisely, but choose quickly.

Vallus acted with religion.  “Woman your name?”

“Trinadon” she replied.

“Lady Trinadon you and your baby are now a Kastron and Gomert here is your wedded husband (Bringling courting rituals could be very terse)

“Take it Gomert.”

Gomert pensively walked to Trina… his urine filled pants made a squishing sound.

I will say the words, you will copy me and you will fill the air.

Lord Villus took the orb and examined each face in turn. He spoke to all: We  
need a warrior, a wizard and a great leader to succeed just as our ancestor  
Rhea.

He handed the orb back to Gomert.

He turned to the first face. Her eyes slowly opened. My child take from me  
my talents, my ability to lead and protect the things we hold dear.... fulfill that  
which I cannot and make the Kastrons a greater name than ever before...  
Her eyes slowly closed and her mouth opened.

Gomert then kissed the mouth and slowly exhaled a baby's volume of air.  The course grains of the stone became soft and a little flexible... then the mouth exhaled and closed.

Gomert turned the stone to the next face. His eyes slowly opened and viewed  
him with sleepy suspicion. Take your marshal inspiration from the moon  
Mikkatra .... make its power our own. Fight the defend house Kastron and fight  
those that stand in the way of our wants....His eyes slowly closed and his mouth opened. Gomert then kissed his mouth and slowly exhaled a baby's breath. The mouth closed and The face twitched a little and a fleshy color started to flow into the orb like blood was pulsing for  
the first time.

Gomert turned the warm and softened stone one more time Her eyes opened  
very little. look to the sky and see our ancestor Harkus Kastron, the wizard  
companion of Rhea herself. Many a Gudling contrivance did he foil. Be the wit  
and winning tactician of the Kastron family.  
Her eyes slowly closed and her mouth gently opened. Gomert pressed his lips  
and forced the last bit of life…but then… nothing happened. The mouth did not close  
and no change could be detected.

What is this, Bey. What has gone wrong. Wait sire. Wait. Give it a moment.

Gomert handed the baby to Trina like it was some type of a deceased frog.  And made some distance.

Nothing like this has ever happened before.

The Klaxon began to sound… the great conjunction was soon to be upon Rheashan.

A little sound came from the mouth... like a burp.

And this caused Gomerts curiosity to grow so he came in for a closer look.

Tiny arms started to sprout from every angle six in all.... and they began to move in little baby like jolts. Still the last baby's mouth was open as if it had not yet accepted the breath.

"Will it be normal? Gomert asked showing a little buyer's remorse"

"Of course I think so sir" Bey answered rubbing his neck line.

Urksa and Aylia summoned by the commotion joined the family on the balcony.  Urksa wore a very concealing hat.

The baby grew a little more and the three heads started to differentiate a little. And still the third baby's mouth remained opened

“How revolting”, Urksa gave her editorial.

The baby will split into three, give it time.

“It will not.” Trina said… she knew it to be true, but did not know how she knew…. Still to her the process was going normally except for the 3rd head which worried her greatly.

And yet the blob seemed to be trying to divide into three…. And tension eased the more the unusual baby seemed to be splitting into three normal babies.

"Wait a minute. I know this girl\! She is the commoner from house Plumper." Urka blurted.

"A slave\! We cannot accept an slave into the Kastron family\! Aylia added.

"Give me that baby" Urka took the baby from Trina's meek and frightened  
Hands…

"Begone commoner, you have no claim to this baby", Aylia commanded. Gomert laughed at this  
Tears flowed of Trina's eyes, she looked to Deebit for support which drew Urka's  
attention to him. "Wait a minute\! It's Deebit...they are servants of Modus\!  Cast them out.

Then a change occurred in the baby.... the third babies eyes opened again  
and quite widely.... the other two seemed distressed and writhed as if in pain. Gomert took his newly forming child and looked at the third face closely .... they  
made eye contact for sure \-- a very unusual thing for a newborn baby to do and  
then a deep belch emitted from the mouth exciting laughter at first until the mouth began to spray black vomit... lots of it all over  Gomert. At the same time the baby became more like stone and Gomert dropped it spewing black vomit all over the floor, walls, ceiling furniture and the Kastrons themselves.

The volume of vomit waned and halted and then the baby closed her mouth  
and eyes. The little hands were reabsorbed and all seemed like the orb had  
completely returned to stone save for disturbed expressions on the other two  
faces. Expressions that Bey said meant they were trying to live but being  
suppressed by face number three.

The unction\!  Pour the unction in the 3rds mouth…. Where is the uncion (chaos do to slippery black liquid caused the unction to be completely lost(

Aylia said, "Its the third head.... cut it before it kills the other two. " She lunged  
for the head which slipped from her hands because of all the black liquid  
Everywhere.

And that was it for Deebit. With rage he doffed his disguise with intent to use his  
sub elementary battle skills to save the child he now felt a cosmic connection to. Cosmic connections don't actually give a person any advantage in a fight. Rooms filled with slippery goo help a lot if your instinct is to stand still because  
you are too terrified to fight. .

Guards and family alike attempted to take from Deebit but were equally stifled by the slipperyness of the black liquid.  And then it was upon them.... the final klakson of the great conjunction.... This baby would be brought to life in the next few seconds or die forever.

Deebit remained still and pondered his options at light speed: He couldn’t fight because he was a legendary weakling, He couldn't run because he would slip and fall. He couldn't wait because eventually they would get a polearm or something and beat him to death.... He couldn't slide  
because... wait a minute. He COULD slide and he did slide right off the railing  
of the balcony. He was a bringling after all and would be safe falling 10 stories  
and tumbling down a thornly hill. It wasn't fun but that's what he did to escape.

He crashed in a thornbush and lost the baby stone for a few moments he  
frantically felt around and said "Seek" and pow, there it was.  
Far above him he could hear commotion... most likely Vallus and Gormet  
commanding some Whysan guards to sacrifice their lives to punish Deebit, but  
they would be too late.

Deebit composed himself for a moment... he looked at the defiant face that had  
rejected Gohmert and her eyes opened for him.

Then he spoke HIS words:  I give you…. MY heart. I give it to  
you so it will be YOUR heart. You will do what you will with your own heart and  
I will love you whatever you become.

The baby's eyes closed and mouth opened.

Nervously, Deebit leaned over and pressed his lips to the infant’s face. He gave his breath and withdrew.... She closed her mouth and her cheeks puffed and flushed a little red.

The stone became flesh and the flesh began to transform.  
The two other heads retracted into the babies innards ... they looked content ...  
not to be reabsorbed but somehow they were being made into one being  
instead of three.

A plump little torso began to balloon from her neck and golden hair curled from  
the top of her head.

Everything else on a baby eventually sprung to life including 2 arms 2 legs ,  
fingers, toes and naughty parts. It was a little girl, pink and perfect.  
Deebit wept.

Then in an instant the baby transformed into a completely different child.... this  
time a slightly larger boy with white hair.

And again the baby made a third transformation and was a completely new girl  
with platinum hair and a pixie cut.

"A trimind" Modus said. He had been standing behind Deebit for a while. "One  
body that shares three minds and the ability to switch to whichever body suits  
Them."

Quick… give her this: He held the magic unction.

In uncharacteristic fashion Deebit swatted the unction away.  “No\!  They don’t need it… I know this\!”

On the balcony Urkla was nonplussed.  “He made a fool of us. Look, he doesn't even have any of the black stuff on him. Use him as a mop.”

It seemed no magic spell could rid them of the black goo which had gone from  
slippery to sticky.

Vallus released his rage, “ How DARE you make a fool of my family.  You are no doubt bound to this Wysan trouble maker Modus\!   
Of course this marriage is now annulled you little slut." Urksa added. "Father  
wasted the last of the unction of Joining on your pathetic monster."

"She bewitched me into marriage" Gomert lamented.

"That can be fixed, but we can't let her or that child--if it lives-- ever lay claim to  
the Kastron name." Aylia posited.

"I say this with authority that supercedes all others as Vallus leader of house Kastron not even anything I have said or will ever say can change the words of this proclomation--" this was the way official documents were created amongst the bringlings--"You are no Kastron and never have been. It is official and unrevokable that neither you nor your abomination shall ever carry  
the name Kastron.  My words are final."

Vallus gave Urksa a look... she prepped her knife and approached Trinadon…

But before she could slash her throat the loudest klaxon of all sounded and  
exotic lights of all kinds flashed into the insides of the castle.

The Conjunction\! Vallus gasped.... All ran to the balcony careful to avoid the  
black goo in which two Whysan's seemed permanently stuck.  
A moment of awe passed over all on planet Rheashashan. Luna's shine was always the  
same but it was very different this time.... light spilled from the celestial body  
and seemed to wind and weave all over the planet a light that was not only  
pretty but a kind that seemed to add something to the very soul of the  
observer. The experience of the light is not something that can actually be  
described in words.

To many it was an explicit sign of the first SELECTION moon....

Typically during this experience all parents held their new babies to the sky as  
they wailed in fear... it was believed the crying was good for the lungs of all  
babies even the ones that didn't become the rulers of the universe on the day  
they were born. But mass fear caused mothers to hold their new infants very  
close to their breasts.

And then the sound stopped and all heard the voice of Rhea speaking to them  
from Luna. "You have spoken the words and you have spoken them rightly." And then the moon exploded back into its three component moons and the  
two largest returned to their orbits... but small and red moon Kardia seemed to be making planetfall.  if anything it got larger and.... it was actually tumbling to the planet.  
Bringlings are robust but no creature in the universe is unafraid of a celestial  
object dropping directly on his face. Mass hysteria broke out.

Trina--moments from having her throat slit--suddenly felt gravitational pull  
of her heart change. Her worries lifted and her body itself began to favor the  
approaching moon. She started to be pulled to the falling moon and on the way  
a tiny thing flew from the ground and into her arms... it was her new baby....  
alive, fully formed and perfect to her happy water gushed from her eyes as they  
spun in a circle on a date with whatever.

Trina held her laughing baby to the sky just as they intercepted the small  
moon, which was not solid, but a soft and cool plasma... like a red heart shaped bubble  
that absorbed mother and child and then squeezed something into them.

And to them and only them Rhea spoke one last time: Listen to others and  
vanquish your foe. Listen to YOUR heart and have no foe to vanquish"  
Then Rhea spoke again so the general public can hear: Now.... say your names:  
"I am Trinadon Wusk of the lost Wuskians.... she held her laughing baby in the  
sky "And here I present Tres, Dyad and Monoli of the Wuskian trimind\!"

Rhea "my chair and my gifts are yours for safe keeping for a while queen regent  
Wusk, choose wisely when you choose to pass them along"  
Then the red membrane of kardia swelled and finally it burst like a gooey souflet.

Gravity reestablished its old relationship with Trina and she fell slowly like the planet itself cradled her and her baby with gentle and loving hands.   But when she touched the ground a massive explosion was released but she was now blessed with Rhea's gifts and no thing, person or object could hurt her. She was the most powerful thing in the universe.  They all were Lady Trinadon, Tres, DyAd and little Monoli.

# PART 3: ESCAPE FROM FLOTILLA

## CHAPTER 1: FAE\*DRA HAILS A RIDE

A Utility Engineer was probably the lowest lifeform in the universe that required an advanced degree.   They held the unkind designation of being called ‘Undies’--not because they were some sort of twisted underwear inspectors (although that would be a promotion)-- they were Undies because they were the only role under that of the Tactical Engineer “Supporties”.  It was a cruel and stupid hierarchy.

An Undie was usually tasked with cleanup work including: collecting debris, installing ordinance, operating high tech equipment and really every job that you can imagine but wouldn’t want to imagine.

Mike and Sal were two undies working on a micro tug cleaning up after the battle of Illus.  Their present charge was the detection, evaluation and extraction of any damaged equipment that might have value.  At the moment Mike and Sal were attempting to tow a derelict drone ship back to the flotilla.

The drone was recoverable, but gnarled from battle and unwieldy which made it tumble when towed. Any attempt to get the drone back to the flotilla with standard techniques would result in tumbling and that would mean slower speed, constant reacquisition of target and high difficulty in steering.

The cockpit of the tug was very cramped and had little room for the two engineers.  The space reserved for a center console had been torched off in favor of a makeshift spaceworthy chess table with actual physical pieces.

They discussed the issues with the cargo and the most efficient way to get the valuable wreckage back to the flotilla:

“The front is bent back like a goose with a broken neck.” Mike said as he sipped his coffee.

“We need to get some bot to cut it off and weld it to the back somehow to make the weight distribution nice and even,” Sal proposed.

Mike: “That’ll take a while.  Why not oscillate the tractor beam and booster assembly to cancel the wobble instead.  It can be done by computer instead of chopping stuff off”

Sal: “Ah, good idea…. \*sigh\* We’ll be back to work in no time.”

They both stared at the chess game for a while.  They were 20 moves in.

Mike: “Of course with YOUR idea we can get the bot to do the work and play more chess.  No one needs to know we aren’t dummies.”

“Of  course we can’t let them know that”, Sal conspired.

Suddenly the drone experienced a catastrophic explosion.

“Did you do that?”, Sal asked.

“No, but it would have been a good idea.  Now we can say it exploded right before we got to the Flotilla.  Even more time for chess\!”

But there would be no chess.  A large crash rocked the tug and the internal atmosphere completely evacuated.  Sal and Mike's Utility Engineering overalls spared their lives with fast acting temporary helmets for  
protection from the harshnesses of space.

"Who shoots a Tug?" Sal asked inquisitively.

"She does I guess." Mike pointed to a pretty girl that floated into the craft like an invited guest.

Repair bots from all over the ship scurried to the wound like blood platelets and rapidly applied temporary measures to restore pressure to the vessel.

"Undies give control" Fae\*Dra commanded.

"Welll, we’re not supposed to do that" Mike

“Yeah, like… we could lose our jobs.” Sal mentioned.

“Undies give control or no more Undies..”

“Oh\!  You’re gonna kill us if we don’t?  They can’t fire us for that.  It’s yours..”

Control was transferred and Fae\*Dra immediately changed the operational parameters and got the tug under way… under very way VERY fast.

"Uhm.... you are running the thrusters at 135%. their recommended operational level is 65%. We  
don't ever go over 65%...."

“Undie's stay quiet" was Fae\*Dra's reaction.

They reached the Red Destiny.

"The Red Destiny\!?" We're not allowed to tow elite ships like this\!" (noresponse)

Time passed.

Sal looked at Mike then the chess board and shrugged.  They started playing.

.The Tow made little sounds prepping for an unusual tractor grab… a lot of cutting could be heard and the undies witnessed important parts of the Tug floating off in space.

“Uhhm…. “  Sal started to speak, but thought it not worth the effort to be ignored again.

Then the boosters ignited with power its handlers knew not it had and the  
tow and Red Destiny made its way back to the Flotilla rapidly.

A large piece of the ship made a sound like it broke and splintered all to hell.

“I think one of the tractor emitters just got yanked out of its  socket,” Mike pointed.

“not safe" Sal added

"Undies stay quiet", She commanded.

Sal was reasonable and  lent to Fae\*Dra and kindly  
informed: “We'll help you with your mission, but the thing is, the way you are  
flying the tow it could up exploding…”\[pause\]”... exploding with us inside it.”

"Then undies can play Chess in space. " A portal open and the gaseous  
innards of the tug escaped a second time nearly blowing Mike completely  
out of the ship.

Mike pulled himself back in and rationalized, "We don't like to play chess in space. All the pieces float away and then Sal accuses me of cheating..."

from Sal: "What we mean is the ship could blow up.” PAUSE. “With YOU in it” …  Also a pause. “And we don’t want YOU to get blown up.”  final pause … “or do you?”

"Can't die in space" she seemed to be referring to how she could live in a vacuum and answered in a way that should end the conversation.

Sal gave a smile.... “but girl. WE”-- (indicating himself and Rekseop) “WE can die in space. I understand it is quite pleasant for you."

Now done with this conversation Fae charged her finger beam and pointed it to the Chess game board.

"Undie's quiet else:" She zapped the Chess board with minimal energy and it went up in minor  
Flames.

"Trump card" Mike said as both extinguished the fire and saved enough pieces.

They looked at each other and accepted that there was no way around being towed back to the Flotilla by a small crazy girl with a powerful finger beam that could easily vaporize their beloved hobby and then Themselves then evacuate the atmosphere venting their charred ashes into space.  That was the whole of the situation.

A long pause.

“This really isn’t even a strange day for an Undie”, Sal added.

Fae Dra's finger began to draw power again and both Undies snapped back to  
Playing chess like they had important work to do...

## CHAPTER 2: SPONTANEOUS EJECTION

Lester lay nestled in a multi layer onion of bliss.  His body lay in bliss in the interior of a cozy escape pod and his mind in deeper bliss deep within the dreamworld he enjoyed by virtue of his cybernetic implants… less drifted… Bliss and stillness… and then MOTION\!?

Less blipped out of his dreamworld.The escape pod was moving and rapidly too.  At the moment it was winding through the conveyance headed to the nearest exterior facing ejection tube on the flotilla.  Less knew that was the process of ejection when the Vulkan’s Pride was moored with the Flotilla.

What was going on?

Less reconnected to the feeds and noticed a flurry of chaotic alarms.  The Zell was upon us? Upon the Flotilla? How? They were days away when he was last connected\!

Tactical Engineers had a technical term for situations like this: “Bad”

Worse, the Zell had breached the perimeter and were presently tearing through the Flotilla defence detail like ants assailing a clutch of grasshoppers.  Worse than worse, Less detected that escape pods were being picked off by Zell snippers… reaching the ejection tube meant certain death\!

Standard issue uniform for a Tactical Engineer was no fashion statement  
consisting of some sort of unisuit covered by unique overalls and sometimes a  
jacket, but these were no mere garments. For every thread covering Lester's  
nakedness had been engineered ad nauseum by Tactical Engineers of christmas  
past and that meant that Less was well equipped by virtue of showing up for  
work. Making Lester's jeopardy less dire to him than what a layman observer  
would surmise.

Equipped in Lester's loadout was the ability to survive in space for some hours,  
intravenous flow of glucose, proteins and oxygenation, 3 automated medical  
bots each the size of a mouse that could crawl anywhere over and in his body  
to apply first aid if needed and attachments for customizations: weapons and  
gizmos to build things, fix things, defensive measures and minor weapons if he  
needed to lay out a little hurt on some enemies.

Choice of weapon was optional and for Lester he favored explosive bomblets: 8 tiny  
balls sized 3 centimeters each they sat snug in a hard covered and tightly  
attached fanny pack that stored and customized each little bomb. The  
bomblets were typically thrown \-- like all bombs \-- at something he didn't want  
to exist anymore, yet they were nothing like dumb bombs. They had the ability  
to float for a while, holme in on a target with a limited ability to arc their  
trajectory and the shape and type of explosion could be modified for a variety  
of deadly effects.

Less decided the escape pod had to go. He reached to the small of his back  
and said "barrier destruction. directed cone. sensitive proximity." with that he  
ordered up a modified bomblet that would constrict its detonation into a  
confined beam of spall in order to tear through a barrier warning the system of  
'sensitive proximity' meaning there was something on the non-business end of  
the explosion that he didn't want harmed (namely himself)

His bomb kit buzzed and vibrated for a moment as it customized his ammo  
then spit out exactly what he ordered into his waiting hand.

Less tossed the bomblet which stuck to the opposite wall of the escape pod. He activated a weak force field on his belt and prepared for impact.

Boom\! A 50 centimeter hole appeared across the way.

The escape pod began to tumble and bounce off the sides of the conveyance. Lester remained  
Fixed to his resting place by virtue of a cable attachment.

Pieces of the escape pod began to fling off and the inside began to crater.  
Lester senses it was time for part 2 of his tactic to escape the escape pod and  
he again activated his weak spherical force field rolling the dial to cause it to  
rapidly expand then contract. His personal forcefield pushed against the inner walls of the  
Pod causing metal fatigue and after a moment and due to the pods compromised situation the entire envelope burst into debris.

Lester curled into a ball and contracted his forcefield as small as possible as bits in pieces of his former hiding place whizzed over and around his invisible sphere of protection.

Well... now he would no longer be injected into space. That part was good. But  
Lester himself was still bumbling and tumbling through the conveyance with  
shards of pod decking everything around him.... This too could become quite  
Fatal.

Now it was time for a new tool of the Tactical Engineer to save our Less. It was  
THE tool of every tactical engineer: The Wrench. Named after an ancient  
engineering implement for tightening bolts it shared a similar shape but lacked  
that vestigial function. The Tactical Engineer's wrench was a mobile device for  
commanding and controlling bots.... the workforce and warmechanism of all  
Tactical Engineers.

Less unholstered his wrench, held it at arms length and spoke the magic  
summoning words "WarBots mobilize\!" The three bots in Lester's retinue  
sparked online in an instant."Bots\! Begin rescue Less. Track location. Plan bypass barrier: 'conveyance tube'execute." In bitspeak Lester commanded all three to track him down and join  
him in the tube....

Once with his companions he would have ample strength to overcome this obstacle.

Less' suit equipped with a simple reaction control system enabled him to orient  
away from his direction of travel. He shot a grappling hook from his left arm port  
and very elastically slowed to a stop after the mechanisms end effector found  
Purchase.

Less yanked a series of cables from various hiding spots on his uniform,  
attached them to the wall and ratched his body as tightly as he could to the  
inner wall of the conveyance as miscellaneous materials sped past him in the  
conveyance sometimes missing him by mere centimeters.

"Less\! Where the hell are you\!?" A familiar voice chimed over the comms.  
"Ed Greely" Less said acidically. He stifled his instinct to ignore Ed and instead  
pinged his location.

"We're close\! Hang on, bud\!" a short burst of static then, "Rodgie, think of  
something\!" Less rolled his eyes.

A few moments later, "We got you in the system.... redirecting you to our  
location" Rodgie said proudly. ... via hacking Rodgie presumably had made the  
conveyance see Lester as a person instead of escape pod debris and  
redirected Less's destination to ... well... wherever they were. Less had planned  
to blow up the tube and get his warbots to extract him. Rodgie’s plan was  
better. Lester puffed and issued a cancel command negating "barrier breach"  
Directive.

"Rodger." Lester confirmed and detached his bindings. His body now under  
the control of the knowing conveyance whisking him to rendezvous with Ed, the  
cadets and his warbot companions.

## CHAPTER 3: UNHAPPY REUNION

Lester exited the conveyance at higher speed than usual. In times of crisis the  
The conveyance operation was faster and less gentle.  He tumbled to the feet of the cadets and recovered his dignity.  Immediately after Critter joined them and took his perch clinging to Lester’s shirt.

"Less"," Mr Mann" "Professor" Each cadet excitedly greeted LEss in their own  
way. Very nice of them especially the one who called him "Professor" since  
Less was nothing of the sort. But their punctuated greetings betrayed the  
motivation for rescuing Lester... they were without an Ed Greely and probably in  
some heap of trouble.

"Zell\!" Rodgie got right to the topic.

"We were attacked by Zell\!" Jet added to the conversation. "They ambushed  
us and chased us here."

“And it called us a bad name\!” added Jett.

"And it hit me in my eye\!", Grey claimed. He pointed to his right  
eye... which looked fine.

"We're cornered. We have no bots. He's coming round the corner:", Rodgie  
gave the important information to Less in a panic.

"Right here in my eye\! it hurts\!", Grey continued.

A Zell on the Flotilla would have to be dealt with. Less raised his wrench and  
again commanded his bots: "continue homing on me. Priority 8"

"8\! we need 10\! they will be here any minute" Jet questioned.  
But Less would not have his superior experience questioned, "priority 9 they  
would get to me ignoring the safety of any human but myself and priority 10  
they would do so ignoring their own safety potentially causing them to arrive  
too damaged to protect us.

" What weapons do you guys have in your arsenal? Dumb looks were returned.

Then Rodgie: "Um... we were sorta paired with Mr. Greely because of an incident involving some weapons at the academy and so then... well... we don't really have any"

“Incident?”

“Well…. We were sorta… shooting them at each other on low power in a dare contest… so they gave us Ed.”

Grey: "My eye is still hurting\!" .

“Edward the savior”.... Less realized he hadn't been rescued so much as summoned to a  
Deathtrap.

"We still have assets, I ran high school track", Jet said. He looked too pudgy to ascend a staircase.

"Uh, okay, you don't need to tell me your other assets.--”  He heard a sound and transformed his wrench into pistol mode.

“A pistol\! “ Exclaimed Jett.

“Don’t get too excited… Tactical Engineering pistols are for cutting materials I’d be lucky if I could shoot this thing in the eye to blind him”

“Yeah\!  The Eye\! Shoot  him in the eye\!” said Grey…

Something was approaching from the corner.... it slowly stalked it's prey as if to  
intimidate the darling little cadets. Breathing and deliberate clinks of claws  
walking across the metal floor grew in loudness and terror... And the creature  
seemed to have asma or something too as its breath was wheasy and evil.

Get behind me. Maybe I can hold them off before my warbots arrive" calmed Lester.

Grey covered his face in fear.

Then, a tiny creature no more than 30 centimeters eclipsed the hallway… a Zell for sure.

Lester completely dropped his guard.  “Do you guys know ANYTHING? That is a Zell boss….”

“Human Scum… You face Vraylar the Zell… Now. Die as you deserve too\!”

“Such words\!” shouted Jett.

But Lester was done.  “Sic” he said to Critter and critter jumped and attacked the tiny Zell… the two were about the same size and they tumbled with Crittter giving most of the beatings

“Ack\! Ack\! Ack\! Ack\!” screamed the little Zell.

“A Zell boss is harmless without troops to command.  He probably got over excited by how cowardly you acted and couldn’t help chasing you down himself.”

Critter disengaged and Vraylar made a hasty retreat.  Lester took his wrench pistol and gave the wretched Zell a little zap in the fanny for good measure… “ACK\!” he said.

“Rodgie If we live through this please remind me to petition the academy to reinstate your weapon permits so you can use them to shoot each other at the earliest convenience”

## CHAPTER 4 WARBOTS MOBILIZE

“Down the hall we will rendezvous with my Warbots.  Be careful.

Each Tactical Engineer maintained a retinue of bots. And this arrangement  
greatly improved the effectiveness of both engineer and bot. For many bots  
were not mindless automatons but they shared very unique personality  
traits. As a matter of fact it was learned ages ago yet never known why that  
a bot's personality core could not be transferred or copied.

Bots without unique personality cores were called robos and bots always  
seemed to outperform robos in Astro Battle. It was assumed that just like in  
humans a diversity of thought and action made tactics more creative and  
harder to predict and counter.

"Uhm, sir. Aren't your warbots broken?" Rodgie asked with hesitation.

And what Rodgie said about broken bots was partially true. There was nothing  
wrong with Lester's bot chassis due to regular maintenance, their personalities  
were however--different. As a matter of fact all three of Lester's bots had been  
in the retinue of other Tactical Engineers before and all three had been slated  
for personality core removal for a variety of defects.

Lester rescued each of them and treated them like beloved family vs the  
typical relationship where Tactical Engineers treated their bots like Eskimos  
of ancient used to treat utilitarian sled dogs that they might get hungry and  
have to eat one day.

His other two Warbots were full-sized and formidable compared to the miniature  
Critter. Critter was really not a warbot at all but a special type of bot that  
moved through tight spaces in machinery to repair wires and equipment. He  
was particularly fast at wiring ships using his tail to doll out cable. Beyond  
that he was very fast, agile a climber and benefited from more than a few  
modifications from Lester himself.

But why would someone , anyone want loyal critter's personality bot cast in the  
fire. Bot personalities are a lot like humans. They have feelings, wants and  
desires. Their ultimate purpose in life is to expect their last bits in the service  
of their human master and Critter was the most exemplary bot of all these  
virtues. Bots also experience trauma that can change their personality core  
forever. It was not known to Less what happened to Critter.... But he was mute  
from the day he entered Lester's service. Less protected him. And what use is  
a mute bot? You'll see.

The two others came as a pair. Nand and Xor. They were powerful but argued  
frequently. Nand was female and prone to making critiques about any plan... She was slated for the crucible not because of incompetence but because Tactical Engineers were tired of having a bot rain on their parade when any and every plan was being wrought.

And Xor was the opposite. He seemed to have no common sense and no  
awareness of danger. Lester fixed both of these capable bots without  
unscrewing a single exterior panel. He just put them together and let Xor do  
annoying things so Nand spend her extra energy criticizing him and keeping  
him in line leaving little room for editorial on how her Tactical Engineering was  
doing.

It was probably the most amazing team in history that also no one respected  
even a lick. And remember this amazing but awful team was down to one tiny  
bot so at the moment this diacotomy of skill was blunted in every way.  
"The junction\!" Rodgie saw the destination and all hover boots terminated as  
their wearers slid to a safe halt. "Where's Mr Greely?"

"Found him\! Ed was standing listless in the middle. " Jet ran to his advisor with  
great excitement. "

No wait\! Less yelled\!,

But his warning did nothing. The moment Jet reached his destination Edward  
Disappeared .... a hologram... and he didn't disappear into just anything. He was now a  
giant Zell brute standing on his hind legs. The Brute swept Jet up and bit his  
head off dropping the body to die

"Jet\! Rodgie and Gray cowarded behind Less.

The Brute fell forward and braced impact with his front arms.... he was now on  
all fours--the preferred walking style for a Zell and atop his mange an unwanted  
thing lay perched-- it was the Zell boss that Critter had just roughed up. He  
had gotten back before they did. Vraylar gave his brute mount the honor of throwing Jet's head in their direction, knocking the cadets down like bolling balls. Lester protected himself from the  
minor projectile using a minor force field.

"Zell scum" Lester insulted. "What the hell do you want?"

More Zell galloped out of hiding and flanked Vraylar's mount hissing and  
gnawing to intimidate their victims. In the next moment it would be total carnage and then the little team of Zell would move on to greater mayhems throughout the doomed flotilla.

Lester chucked a microbomb right at the Brute who countered by opening his  
mouth and generating a spatial distortion geometry. Exactly what Lester wanted.  The bomblet was a delivery mechanism for the shimmer nano-bots. On impact the bomblet exploded and the distortion spread a shroud in an instant. No one could see, but Less and Critter.

Without words critter executed part two. From his tail he fired a micro harpoon  
that connected with the junction ceiling. With one, two, three hands he  
grabbed the remaining living members of the party and then with surprising  
strength hoisted all far above the chaos.

Dangling like gems on a gaudy shadalier all did their best to counter the   
Natural oscillation of angular momentum on a string. Grey's panicked face was pushed right into  
Critters head. Critters eyes blinked yellow and green (his best attempt at  
soothing)

Below confused zell scraped and scratched, bit and blasted every ground  
object they happened into (including each other) in a blind attempt to get to  
their prey. If Vraylar hadn't been barking like mad to get them to stop they  
might have eliminated each other with no further action needed by our heroes.  And in fact two Zell rabble already lie dead.

Command is what makes a Zell boss dangerous. The boss is the anecdote to the  
reckless spirit of the Zell... a reckless spirit that while terrible would make them  
not much of a threat sans guidance.

The Zell, now totally blind made contact and crept together towards an arbitrary  
direction and eventually were able to exit the cloud.... blocking the very hallway  
that Lester needed.

"we need to get back into the shimmer or they might see us up here. Critter spun the party and detached each in turn making them land in different parts of the shimmer soup.

Now all but the Zell were shrouded in the shimmer and a true stalemate was in effect.

Less was beeping and popping on his wrench console then suddenly his entire  
crew could 'see' through the shimmer albeit it was distorted like viewing  
through the bottom of a swimming pool.

Gray saw an option for escape and took down the corridor, but was tripped by  
Critter at Less's command.

On private comms Less: "Dumbass\! once we leave the shimmer they will track us down and it will be head salad all over again."

Let’s get them with this, the Tactical Engineers standard side arm which was  
equipped with a tiny concussive blast emitter--the most powerful and fearsome  
weapon the world had ever seen if the year was 300 B.C and their enemies  
were dodo birds... The standard issue embedded blaster could cut things,  
vaporize barriers and ambush sleeping prey but probably couldn't make a Zell's  
eye tear up if they shot it at maximum power at point blank range. still they  
had utility.

He checked on the status of the warbots.... they were wading through a rabble  
of Zell themselves and would be further delayed.

Ed wasn't so far off.... He generated a hologram of Rodgie and gave it his side  
arm. The reset was easy.... the 3 survivors ambled off into a safe corner  
activated the program and holo Rodgie began firing his weapon in all directions  
, shouting "Die\! You unworthy foe" Zell did not like being called unworthy.

From Lester's control he let the hologram get closer to the edge of the shimmer  
and indeed he lowered the shimmers opacity.

Finally holo Rodgie immerged from the threshold of the shimmer blasting his toy gun in  
every direction "Unworthy\! Unworthy\!" The hologram said (for they had run out  
of creative things to say)  
This stupid move drove the lesser Zell mad. Four Rabbels leapt in the direction of the insults despite the boss Zell's protests that it was an obvious trap and upon contact a concussive explosion destroyed the four Zell in a satisfying way.

"Crimpers\!" Fight us fair not with some bad mannered hologram.  Vraylar protested.

"Lets stop this fighting and go see a movie or something", Lester channeled his  
half brother Alexander sometimes when he taunted the Zell.

"Movie\! What’s that?  We can sit through your decimation... or our own.... nothing less."

The Zell loosed some encouragement into the shimmer in the form of bolts of  
energy. One hit would send a cadet to heaven, but the shimmer made that  
unlikely since it was a large space and the Zell simply couldn't see.  
"If you put your face in you can see us better." Lester offered. This made his  
cadets incredulous. But every Zell came from a long line of many things... one  
of those being a complete dummy.

Again against the pleas of his Zell boss a Rabbel thrust his head into the  
shimmer only to recoil suddenly with some type of pink goo permanently  
hardened to his eyes and face.

"Perfect, Critter." Lester praised

Two more Zell leaned in to see how their comrade had been taken off the roster  
list so to speak including the Brute. Their comrade writhed in agony and started to have some success ripping the pink glue from his facial carapace he cussed the human party. Gluing   
eyes shut would have passed as a juvenile prank not a wartime advantage  
had not Lester laced the glue with one of his concussion bombs. BOOOM  
The afflicted and two closely witnessing his struggle lost their heads .... This battle was almost over. But it wasn't as dust settled

Four Zell laid slain, but the biggest one, the Brute that the Boss was riding,  
his carapace was too strong. Lester's bombs had no effect on his powerful  
Armor..

Ack Ack Ack Ack Ack\! Suck It\!” screem Vraylar.

Rodgie looked at Lester , perhaps hopeful for what the command "Suck it" might mean, but neither expected it to be fun.

It turned out to be an unconventional attack on the shimmer. As his Brute 'began  
to deeply inhale or suck in the shimmer'.... the brute complied. In a matter of  
minutes the shimmer was gone for in Astro Battle there is always measure and counter  
measure . The moment a Tactical Engineer starts to rely on a solution is  
the moment before he dies after his counter produces a totally unexpected  
counter measure.

In moments the key to the party's stealth would be gone. Grey imagined some  
fresh carnage that he didn't want to live through. and lost his mind.

“I surrender. I will surrender to you if you promise my safety and that of my  
Comrades.”

"We don't have any safety for ‘people’ only scum.” Vraylar relished victory

Grey: "Ok.... thats fine."

The Zell boss liked this. "Young creature , They have us Zell wrong.... human  
life is precious to us and saving one is the greatest aim. Come. Join us and  
help us end this little war. We do not, however, save 'comrades, only first  
movers brave enough to love us Zell gain our respect as they should so move  
Fast."

Grey sprang for the opportunity, now afraid of losing his first mover advantage.

Lester shrieked "It's a TRAP. " But Grey wasn't having it. He ran right to the  
clutches of Vraylar's brute

Grey: "I know but I can' t help it. There's something about having my head chopped  
off that just makes me depressed all day. I'll do my best to negotiate your  
Survival.

The Shimmer was almost gone at this point and a relieved Grey approached  
Vraylar and his Brute.

"I Surrender. I have always had the greatest respect scary monsters and \-- hey \--- "

Grey's speech would have gone on but was halted when they started to manhandle him.  
The Brute lifted Grey in the air and shoved Grey's head in his mouth.  
"MY eyes\!" was Greys last words before the Brutes beak crushed down and  
Made him into a  headless corpse.

Vraylar and the remaining two rabble laughed at their little trick.

Thinking fast Less released a simultaneous attack of four microbombs.... Customized from his kit each was bestowed with a special shaped charge in the service of decapitating that problematic Brute.

Explosion\! The two rabbles were completely obliterated never to bother  
anyone again and the Brute had been knocked on his back.

It was unclear how much damage he had taken and of course the boss was missing.

Lester now had 2 microbombs left. The first was infused with nano-shimmer if  
a little more time was needed to beat a hasty retreat.... The second’s configuration wasn’t determined yet.

Rodgie and Less approached the carnage with great caution...  
All seemed in order, potentially the boss was trapped under the girth of the  
mighty brutes's body.

Lester stopped first and released a tiny camera bot to float all the way up and  
capture a closeup of the carnage. But impatient Rodgie walked right up close  
enough to see over the mighty beasts' belly and in a flash Rodgie was snatched  
by the neck. Lester retreated back and exploded his second to last micro bomb,  
creating a new shimmer zone temporarily throwing the Zells off his trail.

It was only a matter of time before the Zell suck machine did his environmental  
duty again and Lester would be cornered.

"Hahahaha\! chortled Vraylar. You humans are dumb" (no one argued this  
statement)

Rodgie writhed and paniced.... he knew what was next for him.

Suddenly a high powered sniper blast ripped through the hall and hit the brute in the eye. No  
Effect.

"That's my Rodgie, you can't have my Rodgie\!" Greely chimed in.

Lester frantically checked the status of his warbots. They were close...  
seconds away even, but that was meaningless. This conflict would end now. A  
final ruse was needed and his quick mind had an unconventional idea  
He pushed his final bomblett back into the kit and command strip anti armor,  
propulsion leave bear. Add primitive contact fuse.... the little device went to  
work customizing the explosive.

"Wait." Lester said to the beastie. Put him down. I am in charge. I will  
negotiate surrender of the entire flotilla AND tell you where the Tzo Crystal is located on this ship "Tzo chrystal?" Ed Gasped

On private comms "So thats whee you were hiding, Ed.... don't ruin my bluff "

"This scrawny thing for you and a Tzo Crystal..... but we get to keep his head."

"No, he we all keep our heads I don't know about you but we humans like our  
heads. Give us that and I take you to the real Tzo crystal... not a fake."

"Accepted" Vraylar chimed without even considering the deal.  
The Brute dropped Rodgie who scurried away. And Lester slowly emerged from  
the safety of the shimmer... quite, stoic, his mouth stressed but slammed shut  
The brute grabbed Less and pulled him close to his gaping jaws... precisely a  
move not in accordance with the agreement, but Less did not flinch.  
"No words, human. No Matter. We Zell care nothing for a Zto crystal.... But that  
is a very nice head I would like to have it ..."

Vraylar clicked the stirrups of his mount and the Zell brute opened wide to accept his next victim, but then Lester spit something out a tiny ball that projected through the air and into the  
brutes open mouth, probably landing deep in his stomach.

At that time the Brute dropped Lester in a panic and started to shove both  
hands down his throat in an effort to retrieve whatever it was lester had just  
Spat.

Vraylar looked in confusion.

Then with rocket speed Critter jumped to the small of Lester's back. His tail  
was firmly attached to something deep in the shimmer. In an instant the tail  
contracted and Lester was brought to a safe 20 meters away Vraylar gave a look to Lester like   
"That wasn't fair" but it was too late. The brute’s stomach quickly expanded and an unsatisfying boom rang out like a man holding in a sneeze... Black smoke flowed from the Brutes mouth over his green and confused eyes and then in the next second he fell to the floor dead. The Zell were no longer a threat.

"Vraylar sat stunned trying to process his spectacular defeat for a moment..  
At this point Lester's standard issue pistol could have made quick work of the  
little monster but in the spirit of all the fun the Zell were trying to have Less  
decided the party shouldn't just end.

"What do we do with the boss? " asked Rodgie.... Lester gave a knowing look  
and suggested "Drop kick him to the nearest moon"

Rodgie, now activated and deputized, put on a protective glove, easily chased  
down and captured their rival and then gave him a rather excellent drop kick.

“Ack\! Ack\! Ack\! Ack\!” SPLAT\!

"How did you know I played football in college?.

But no answer from Less.... he was already onto the next task.

Edward dislodged himself from his hiding spot and stoically approached the  
dead. Being a soldier and mentally fortified for death as he should have been  
wasn't enough in this moment. Greely shed some tears and received more  
comfort from Rodgie and Less who were more stoic about the loss of their  
Comrades "At least they didn't get you, Rodgie\!" Ed cried… I was waiting for the right shot… i couldn’t do it without you, Lester.

Then a large bang.... a service panel on an unseen hall fell off..... Ed and Rodgie  
hugged each other in anticipation of more face eating, but Less knew only to  
feer a blasted panel for a cut panel meant warbots.

"Repair weld access" Nand nagged Xor. "suspend repair caused scuttle" Xor  
"You fixed every breach you created? Is that what took so long\!? Don't  
Answer."

Now that are chances of survival are up, I guess we ask the question what to  
do, posited Ed.

"Escape." said Less, "WE have to escape the flotilla and make it to the fold"

## CHAPTER PARTING COMPANY

"I got the codes to a small cloaking scout ship. Very small.... As a matter of fact we got kinda lucky when those Zell ate up Grey or he would have had to sit on my lap. Not so lucky for you and Rodgie."

"Rodgie is twice my size\!" Argued Less

"He's gotta bad back.", Ed replied matter of factly.

"You're both smaller.... You could ride on each other's back." , offered Rodgi

Ed:"Yer still learning what it means to be a tactical engineer, Rodgie.... There are just a number of important technical reasons why you can't sit on my lap I don't have time to explain it to you."

Scout ships were used for reconnaissance or for moving small but high value assets through danger zones. The vehicle role was typically small with minimal weapons or defence--often NO weapons or defence-- and they fell into one of two categories of either being fast or stealthy with the most stealthy sporting fully operational cloaks.

"There are still issues," Less persisted. "most Cloaks are only effective at distances over 100 kilometers or so and they are even harder to maintain if the vessel is surrounded since cloaks are directional in nature.

So using a cloak to get to the fold bubble in time is going to mean getting picked off by point defence system right after we launch

Less: "If we fly away from the fold--where the Zell are less in force at the moment... we might go unnoticed, but then we'll be traveling in space for months before we reach the most primitive space faring civilization near us on account of the fact that we cannot engage faster than light. That means we need supplies for things like.... well we have to feed HIM (referring to Rodgie) And the idea of him getting bigger while sitting on my legs for some months is turning me off to your scout ship plan.

"We could amputate and preserve your legs and reattach them when we make planetfall", Rodgie suggested (his unorthodox approach was supported by modern technology)

"How bout we amputate your torso and leave both parts here instead" Lester quipped.

Ed: "No need to discuss any further... I got a plan that will work.... I'll have months to tell you all about it as we zoom to safety"

"Maybe I would like my ears to be amputated for the duration of the journey", Less said.

Less gave up and figured he could come up with a better solution once he saw the ship.... perhaps putting everyone in a makeshift coldsleep modification would make the trip bearable.

Then Less received an unwanted notification. Item IM-RY3 had still not left the vault. He stopped cold.

Ed:"Less, what's wrong\!? We gotta get a move on..."

Less: "something has come up. I'm going to the vault"

Ed: "You gettin another one of your broken bots\!? I swear you and those bots you better not be having sex with them"

Lester gave a disapproving face.... NONE of his bots were even humanoid and plus: "Gross"

Lester jumped into the nearest conveyance tube. His three bot companions followed.

Rodgie shrieked: "That's dangerous"

"You can't use conveyance, the Zell are already in there", Ed warned.

"I've programmed my bots to have sex with them.... there shouldn't be any trouble." Xor looked at Nand inquisitively... Critter's eyes flashed yellow (the color of confusion), "To the vault" BOOM\! they were gone,.

"The vault will be the most heavily saturated by enemies on the flotilla.... he won't survive.", said Rodgie

"He'll be okay. We've come through many impossible scrapes together. Don't worry.... I know why you're worried and you shouldn't. He'll survive and train those bots of his to have sex with YOU too someday Rodgie.

"Too many ‘sex’ jokes", said Rodgie

“Hahah\! Just joking…. Hey\! Less forgot his pistol… Well, I guess you learned your lesson” Ed handed the pistol over to Rodgie.

## CHAPTER TO THE VAULT

Organics traveled through the conveyance by the use of some sort of vehicle, but they were in short supply. Instead Lester hacked the system to think he was a vehicle and he used his Tactical Engineering 'cacoon' a spherical shield which was weak but covered him from all directions and allowed him to bounce off walls from all directions. Another advantage to the cocoon was that it canceled outside inertia... in other words as the little globe was tumbling, bumping, flipping and spinning Lester didn't feel any of it ... to him he was sitting in a small but quiet office working on his next plan.

Of course the cocoon was weak as for mentioned and in battle served little more protection than deflection of debris and the lowest level weapons.

Larger debris like that crashing through the conveyance tubes at the time could easily give Lester a bad day and that's where Nand and Xor came in.

"Boom\!" Xor used his blaster to annihilate an incoming piece of debris then Nand zapped individual shards with her point defence beams

While all tumbled through the windy tubes of the conveyance Nand & Xor argued in bitspeak.

Nand: "Xor is shorted (an idiot)."

Xor: "more" ( more information please)

Nand: "...Blaster create spall... Master in danger. ergo: Xor is shorted."

Xor: "Not. (you're wrong) Nand assist with PDL. Master safe. ergo: Not "

Nand: "Rejected. Tactical pivot:. spacial distortion cone. Supposition: No danger to Master."

Xor: "Rejected. 'Suppasitions are superstitions' say master. “

Nand: Rejected. Supersitions are not suppasitions therefore nonequivilancy.

Xor: "Nand buffer overflows (talks too much). Sollusion Nand \>\> /dev/null (this was an ancient command expression meaning all future communication would be sent to null/garbage.... a joke from Xor) \-- alternative solution: Nand use weld and weld off own head.

As they approached the vault antechamber the conveyance exit hatch opened and critter harpooned a structural pillar and began winding Less into the chamber.

This was a waiting room for people to petition and wait for vault items that had some kind of administrative lock on them and weren't allowed to travel by conveyance summons.

## CHAPTER ITEM IM-RY3

It was immediately obvious why the vault conveyance for normal items wasn't working as well.... the entire place was crawling with Tekanoids.

"Nand\!" Less commanded her to handle the situation... She created a spatial distortion cone and pushed it through the crowded space knocking all the little tekanoids on their backs, but not hurting them much.

Tekanoids were not intentionally harmful to anyone but their mere presence was a concern. Their entire interest was new technology. They were the carrion eaters of deep space and showed up after every battle looking for things to take. And often they showed up DURING the battle if the battle scenario seemed already tidally locked.

They looked like little shiny silver metallic children with a rounded head hunched over something like a metal lipstick cover for a body... Their hands and feet were metallic black. The face was a smooth round glass surface like a vid screen that would project facial expressions like usually blue eyes and below a speaker for making noises and from their mouth sometimes extended a long soft metallic prehensile tongue.  Actually they looked like little salt shakers that came to life and waddled all over the place.

When not being bowled over by a minor spatial distortion cone, they liked to look at things and especially feel for technology... In this room every button, every junction box and every wire had been certainly fondled by Tekanoids as the chit chatted about the quality and vintage of their finds.

And the "pat pat" process with the hands was not just a ritual... they were sharing information with other castes, bigger and scarier customers that would start lasering off the good stuff and hauling it to their salvage craft.

That meant the rest of the vault would soon be broken into and Lester's prize would be lost forever if he did not act.

As Tekanoids recovered their faces flashed with red disapproving eyes and they made a clicking noise. It was their way of saying "This is our stuff"..... their giant tongues swayed back and forth pointing at the things Lester and his crew and that was a way of saying "something bigger is going to come and you're going to get it.

Critter went wild and jumped from tekanoid to tekanoid yanking tongues and knocking them down again and occasionally he summoned his inner ancestor and beat his chest like he was powering up to go super gorilla.... that seemed to put them in disarray.

Xor stepped up to give them a point blast taste of plasma cannon which would have settled the issue and wrecked the room, but before he could unleash hell's inferno Nand stopped him violently... The two rolled around on the floor fighting each other. In one case they flattened a couple tekanoids which further increased the Tekanoids’ agitation.

It was quite the chaotic mess, but adequate for Lester's needs. Whether the Tekanoiids would leave or not was no matter as long as they stayed out of his way.

Lester started to approach the console, he entered his credentials and summoned biological artifact IM-RY3 . The vault seemed to be working fine which was a relief. Lester assumed some connection to the conveyance was the reason he couldn't receive his personal item since the vault itself was completely intact.

In a moment a hatch opened and up ascended IM-RY3 in the form of a standard storage cube for a cryogenic biological component... that meant it contained technology to keep its contents alive in some sort of cryogenic hibernation. Lester grabbed the container . It required two hands to hold and was about the width of his torso.

Lester then used the console to summon a few items to assist in the getaway.

The tekanoids were getting fed up and starting to leave. Less began the process of attaching floatation clamps to the cube so he nor his companions would be burdened with carrying it since they surely had other tricky challenges headed their way before they survived the flotilla dwindleing into chaos.

Just as he finished one of those challenges presented itself. A tight beamed red laser blast cut through the room zapping between Lester and his prize and hitting a cluster of piled up junk behind. The hit caused a huge explosion pushing Lester forward in a roll and knocking Lester's prize to the far corner.

The Tekanoids cheered and made a new clicking sound, running around with their hands in the air. Critter, now frightened, stopped his rampage and jumped to Lester to see if he was okay and Nand and Xor stopped fighting each other for a moment.

Something big had to be dealt with but to Lester the Tekanoids finally got too annoying. Lester merely said "Nand, let him" both bots knew what that meant.... Xor then stepped forward and without harassment released a small plasma blast into the Tekanoid crowd sending tekanoids careening in every direction.... when they bounced off the walls and came to rest on the floor none were killed but they certainly had too much and each in turn got up to scurry away.

Nand wasted no time while Xor shooed the small fry .... she was blocking the thing that had fired at Lester and ready for battle. It turned out the Tekanoids had summoned a Tekanoid rollie which had just laser drilled through the wall.

Rollies were long centipede like robots a little larger than a man... They had a powerful cutting and attacking laser in their mouth as well as chewing mandibles. Rollies shared a glass expression plate for their face and their exterior armor segments were made of smooth silvery metal exactly like the Tekanoid salt shakers themselves. Finally rollies could roll into a ball to protect all their softies making them a little hard to kill at times.

This Rollie was going to be a little tough, beyond Critters skill of head leaping and chest beating. The Warbots were going to have to throw down.

The Rollie was laying down a constant beam on Nand who was using a spatial disturbance field to dissipate energy.... the two countered each other in a slow clockwise move around the room. It was a game of attrition waiting to see who would run out of stamina first for both attack and defence of energy weapons consumed power.

A second Rollie slithered through the opening who Xor instantly blasted to bits. Then a third Rollie leapt through, but this one rolled into a ball and Xor's attack was ineffective

A fourth and a fifth rollie began to slither through.

Lester decided to end Nand's stalemate first. "Xor interrupt and Nand 'rang' him.. execute."

Xor then jumped in between Nand and the lasering Rollie interrupting the beam with his own distortion field while at the same time Nand released her boomerang which arced around all combatants and sliced the rollie in two between its segments then returned to Nand.

Lester lunged for his prize box, but was assailed by another Rollie whose mandibles were wide open and prepped to snip something off of Lester he might miss but the techno monster was foiled when Critter intercepted and held between them and with great strength held the mandibles at bay.

Lester shoved the weak beam emitter of his tac wrench right under the rollie's segment and gave a sustained blast. Smoke and a frying sound could be heard as well as what looked like some sort of soldiery goo started dripping out of the belly. Critter noticed the pressure being exerted by the mandibles began to weaken and then the Rollie just fell to the ground.

They were being quite a team, but more and more rollies kept coming through and the crack in the wall was getting bigger.

Lester grabbed his prize and started a fighting retreat back to the conveyance.

Then.... a small explosion was heard on the other side of the crack and the rollies stopped coming through.... as a matter of fact the rollies there decided to retreat.

Lester could hear the rollies hissing and clicking in the same way to protest the presence of some claim jumper but that didn't last long. Things were already escalated and it sounded like a barrage of laser blasts from the rollies had been unleashed early but they sounded all over the place and as if they couldn't get their target.

Lester winced at the sounds... there were clearly a lot more rollies on the other side than he had anticipated and if not for this lucky development escape may not have been possible.

Then for almost a moment a ruckus of bangs, scrapes and the satisfied sound of steel being sheared like a sharp knife cutting paper and things got much quieter.

Clearly there was at least one Rollie left ... he was still clicking and hissing but he was retreating back through the crevice and then BOOM\! A much larger hole exploded into the anteroom spraying debris and parts of rollie everywhere.

CHAPTER THE GIRL

Lester knew he had to run but was frozen with curiosity. What terrible creature could easily dispatch so many deadly foes so quickly. He didn't have to wait long.

Through the smoke of the new entry wound a small figure floated into plain view. It was a nine-year-old girl.

She pointed her tractor finger at Lester's vault box IM-RY3. The box flew to her hand. She turned and floated back into the smoke.

Lester stood dumbfounded for a moment... at a complete loss.

Xor started to pursue the girl, but Nand blocked his path... this time a stern look of yellow eye lights was all that was needed after both had had their daily fill of fisticuffs. Critter also looked to Lester for guidance, stifling his instinct to swoop over and steal the loot.

"Was that a human or a bot? She was the strongest thing I have ever seen. And why did she take my personal vault item,"

A second vault item was just delivered... a fresh supply of bomblets in the form of a bandolier .... 64 ammo in all...  a powerful pistol side arm, top rated Tactical Engineering trousers and Tactical Engineering armor Lester donned his new gear still in a daze.

He continued to think: 'Clearly this being was human if only in part and could not be blown up just like every other problem we've faced recently because of ethics. Plus she has it. The whole thing I'm here to protect.

"warbots, begin mission."

"objective: acquire cube from girl. constraints: safety for girl."

"sub Critter. begin Mode: mobile stealth. track 'her'. stream reports. execute"

Critter burst through the broken wall tracking the mystery girl...

"sub Xor: grant auth on attack to Nand revoke on Xor:

Xor shuttered at this and Nand delighted... Xor could no longer use any attack without Nand's approval.

"sub Nand: grant auth on defend to Xor revoke on Nand" Nd approval from Xor for defensive actions."

"release constraint condition: if defences \> attacks \* 5 override Nand."

(meaning for every 5 defences that Nand allowed Xor would get one attack without the need for approval from Nand....

IT was a cleaver program of checks and balances to keep the two from failing the mission because of their proclivities.

"execute" the plan was now in effect\!

Unexpectedly Critter flew backward piercing the smoke reentering the room at high speed and crashed into the opposite wall. No damage, but a bit of a shock.

Lester speaking to himself again, "Yes, this will be harder than I thought"

He composed himself for a while and connected to the Flotilla feed… seek… scan… seek… GOTCHA\!  Lester found her via the Flotilla surveillance.

"She's in the conveyance.... not sure her final destination, but she'll soon pass through junction TL-22-22-8. That's where we will nab it" He had made a hasty plan as he needed to quickly recover the cube and get everyone off the flotilla.  He accessed the Vault and summoned a thunder spear.

Twelve minutes later Lester and crew were in their ambush position

The girl sailed through junction TL-22-22-8  as smooth as glass with cube in tow very unlike the bumbling and tossing of Lester’s technique earlier.

At the appointed place a precision explosion ripped through the tube mere meters in front of the girl.... it was a thunder spear that passed right through and that pierced two holes about half a meter in diameter each.

20 milliseconds later the girl passed the cavity and Critter leapt through the first piercing grabbing the cube with his tail and sailed through the exit wound.... in another second the girl was hundreds of meters away,

Critter barreled into Lester's arms... both elated they had recovered the. huh? Critter's tail and the cube were both missing\! What went wrong?

Lester looked at the feeds again and noticed that the cube was still with her with part of Critter’s tail flapping in the wind... attached to the cube but severed from Critter himself.

'She countered us in milliseconds.' He thought.... I can't go easy on her... she's dangerous even if she is a little girl.

Lester observed the spy feeds a little more.... He watched as she ripped through a small rabble of Zell like they were paper.

She's going to the elite hanger he was finally able to discern... who is she and what is she up to? A malfunction?

## CHAPTER FAE\*DRA vs the ZELL

Lester's 3rd plan to foil the girl with super powers was by way of stealth and help from the Zell and most importantly he resolved to abandon ethics.

Of course Less and the Zell weren't allies, but it stood to reason that if she got into a fight with a large host of Zell she would either flee, leaving the cube or get killed.

Lester figured the Zell themselves would have no interest in the cube and when they left he could retrieve it later so long as a Tekanoin salt shaker parade didn't clepto its way through the aftermath later.

Less watched from an air vent high, high in the ceiling of a large spacecraft repair bay. As the girl casually walked towards the hanger \-- her presumed destination \-- two squads of Zell would be injected by Xor and Nand.

Anyone who thought they could herd Zell doesn't know the Zell, but Lester had a great plan. Lester had equipped Critter with his bomblets and given him a little training on the proper care and feeding of high yield explosives and sent him off to harass the Zell in various places. He also equipped the tiny robot with a megaphone speaker attachment so he could play recordings like "Zell are stink... They need ath bomb" BOOM\!

Of course such obnoxious behavior caused the Zell to chase Critter who was able to escape at lightening speed (including the ability to use exceed to avoid blast bolts and tractor whips.) And it was to this point, far below a large invading army of Zell spilled into the maintenance room spoiling for a fight with a little monkey bot who just zipped past a little girl as if to say "if you wanna get to me you gotta go through this single layer cardboard box first.

The girls stopped cold and this was a good sign that she knew she faced a challenge... the sinister agents of the Zell slowed as they approached her.  Among them were at least fifty rabble and three Brutes--each of whom bore a Zell boss. They would surely tear that precious thing to bits.

Lester’s look of satisfied anticipation gave way to a more empathetic expression, "What have I done." He whispered. But I have to have it.”  Then from her backpack some things emerged. One, Two, Three floating blades detached and surrounded her–their pointy sides facing the enemy. The blades were each about 30 centimeters in diameter and perfectly triangular.

Each vertex was a sharp cutting edge. They could fly in any direction but on one of the edges was a flattened booster.

"Kill her" a Zell boss fired off this command nonchalantly and a single rabble charged towards her... when he got near two blades stopped him by pressing their flat sides on either edge of his belly to give him a squeeze.  Trapped as he was he could not stop her from floating him directly over the Zell boss that gave the order to attack and while he hovered there the third blade cut the floating Zell in two releasing all its blood an innards over the Zell boss.

All blades returned to their starting position flanking the girl. The entire move seemed to be an

opening warning from Fae telling the Zell, "Don't try me"

"Sprawl, you moron... can't even kill a girl.... YOU ATTACK\!", the 2nd Zell boss thought he could do better and another non-descript Rabbel launched the exact same attack.

But as he approached he was bonked on the head by a suddenly appearing blade on the blunt side with such force that he did a back flip right overtop the 2nd Zell boss.  At the moment a second blade severed the animal in two right through the anus. Blood and guts rained all over the 2nd Zell boss.

"Ha Ha HA\! YOu crimping fools, you can't even kill a simple human without getting slop all over you." Lester recognized this Zell's voice for it was Vraylar once again.

"We really need to kill that guy next time", Lester thought

"We do not fear your trapazoids, girl", the first Zell said.

"They aren't trapezoids, they are rectangles\!", said the second Zell.

"Fool, you don't know your weapons. They are trapezoids because first they trap you then they slice you" said the first"Wrong, they are Rectangles... didn't you see how they enter through the rectum?"

"Idiots\!" It was Vraylar's turn to 'add' to the conversation.... "They are TriAngles, because I will win on the third attack with three Zell. I will demonstrait.... Triple attack now\!"

But before any assailant could take a step to threaten her all three in Vraylar's attack group had lost their heads and the girls weapons seemed to have returned already... ready for the next wave.

"Charge her\!" Vraylar said with anger fueled by his pride.... a LARGE number this time, between 20 and 30 Zell launched a melee attack... Fae\*Dra simply stood there, completely unconcerned. They pounced on her and tore the area to threads... then paused... one Zell looked to Vraylar and said "She's gone" Then a large piece of equipment fell from the ceiling killing all thirty asialants.'

Lester spoke to himself, “keep underestimating this one…”  The he saw the cube laying safely away from the carnage.  He didn't know where she was only that now was his time... with the help of Critter he began his decent to the surface.

"Where is she? Where did she go?" Vraylar said with bruised pride.

"yo." She replied. She was standing on Vraylar's brute directly behind Vraylar.

The two other Brutes saw this and lunged to attack her, but when they got there both her and Vraylar’s brute had been moved to another location in an instance..... the two Brutes ended up tearing each other to bits also killing their riders.

The remaining twenty or so Zell were now in a frenzy of fear and from atop the last Brute she fully released her three blades which started flying in a tight spiral pattern all around her position. Zell and Zell body parts were being tossed around like they were in a cyclone of razor blades with the girl in the eye

of the storm.

Less' feet were firmly planted on the ground about 10 meters from the cube ...he tip-toed as best he could to retrieve it before his distraction was done for.

The screams from the Zell had stopped, yet she let the 'blender' run for a few more seconds for good measure.

Then sillence.

Vraylar looked straight up to see the girl behind him.... he started yanking the reins frantically trying to get it to save him, then he looked down and realized he was sitting on a floating head.

The girl was pointing at him, presumably with a tractor finger causing him and the head to float. The body of the Brute was ruined on the floor and the girl herself was just floating in the same place before she decapitated her stand.

Vraylar undid his stirrups and the head fell to the ground.... the girl twisted him around to face her.

Less grabbed the cube and started running to the extraction point where

Critter waited to whisk him away...

The girl looked at Vraylar for a second then reversed the polarity and increased the pulse strength of her finger tractor sending poor Vraylar flying into a wall 300 meters away. Splat\!

Lester ran and was almost to Critter when all the sudden something hit him in the buttocks so hard it flipped him upside down.... as he sailed through the air he was hit in the butt probably another dozen or so times. And when he crashed in a pile of debris he realized the cube was gone.

"Spankings are for TacEng, because Alexander say no kill TacEng."

The Cube floated back to her, she turned and continued walking like she had just encountered a minor obstacle.

Pause of defeat…"I don't have a chance of beating her" Lester said as he rubbed his heinie.  But… she said “Alexander….”

He performed more facial closeups and did some image enhancements and cross photo computer analysis and then \-- no way. He recognized this person. This was his brother's Androsynth. Lester's blood boiled, "What in the hell is he doing with my vault cube\!" ... he furiously tried to raise him on the comms but nothing. Lester assumed he was in some battle somewhere... the world was going to hell but he wanted his answer anyway.

Ok. all bets are off. I'm going to talk to this androsynth before she gives the cube to Alexander. And if either of them get in my way all bets are off. I've beaten you before, you know…

## CHAPTER FAE\*DRA AND LESS

Fae\*Dra had entered the large aircraft maintenance complex and was calmly walking to the connected hanger.

Lester ran to approach her and yelled "Androsynth\! Stop what you are doing. That vault cube is mine\!"

"TacEng go away", she replied without breaking her stride.

"I know what you are doing.... I will use all force if I have to"

No reply.

Lester fixated on the cube... his obsession watered down his judgement. "Well, if that's how it is, send Alexander my regards".

BOOM\! In a flash a triangular blade instantly appeared in front of Lester's face.

It must have traveled at an undetectable speed. Lester could still feel strong air current pushing back his cheeks as the blade settled in thin air, vertical in orientation bisecting his face down his ventral line.

"Care what you say TacEng." ... the blade pushed closer with the tip pinching Lester's nose... "Else there will be two TacEng... one that falls to the left and one that falls to the right."

With that point made very clear to Lester he backed off of his plan to detonate explosives above her. He and his team were no match for this androsynth. The cube was lost to him.

He sat on the ground in despair...

"Why does he want it anyway? Why does my brother want with.--" with those words Fae\*Dra stopped, turned and looked at Lester for the first time... her eyes seemed to be making some computer analysis.

"You are Lester Mann... half brother to Alexander Holmes. You are the best TacEng in the Ronin fleet but lazy and disengaged." She was reading from a script because she wasn't talking like herself.

"Alexander sent you to help with mission?" She asked.

"I dunno... why don't you ask him?"

Emotion welled up... "Alexander is dead. I am to take biological sample IM-RY3 to reflex point."

Lester stood back up and softened his demeanor. Alexander was dead. His brother was dead.... and maybe he was trying to save the cube all along.....more emotion welled up.

"Let me help you."

Fae\*Dra repeated: "Lazy and unmotivated" like it was a rejection letter for a resume.

"The best tactical engineer in the Ronnin fleet. Alexander wrote that. He knew I could do this. And he also knew the ONLY thing I care about in this universe is in that cube. Take me and my companions and with your strength and my strategies we will complete the mission for sure."

A moment passed as Fae\*Dra thought

"Accepted"

CHAPTER THE FORLORN HOPE

They entered the hanger and witnessed as the red destiny was being worked over by bots just as it had been before the previous mission. This particular work was grueling as the previous core was being cut out having been fused to the hull. The cannon blast stunt that Alexander pulled also damaged many subsystems not meant to handle such load and much had to be replaced.

Lester was interviewing Fae\*Dra about the mission... he realized she didn't really understand what needed to be done but seemed confident in her ability to punch her way through her troubles. But he got most of his information from plans on file she shared with him.

"So the arks are going into a temporal fold....my understanding is that they will reemerge months or years later in another location having experienced almost no passage of time. Ok, that's good. But...looking at these readings something bothers me... it looks like the time dilation is such that they will unfold sometime after the end of the universe itself.... won't that be a problem?"

"We save them", Fae gave little nuggets of the plan that she didn't fully grasp.

"Yes, I see... a specific type of energy pulse (sorry this is not my field) will be used to dislodge the arcs near the Zell hatcheries and then the final battle will commence.... and how will that pulse be administered...."

"By the Ronin fleet" Fae\*Dra was annoyed to have to tell him the obvious

"Uhm.... the Ronnin fleet is almost decimated.... there is no way anything can survive without folding and now we know the fold itself is a ticket to limbo"

"Stop being lazy TacEng" Fae commanded.

"Can the temporal fold variables be modified?"

"No"

We're gonna have to make a run for it then.... I know you love your ship, but maybe we would be better off in a cloaking vessel.

"The Red Destiny is Alexander's ship"

"I know but Alexander is..." He didn't want to get cleft in twain for dancing around that tricky subject....

"Tell me androsynth, what is your actuation number?"

"6"

Lester was annoyed, "No I meant your actuation number... the number of machines you can control besides your own body?"

"6" she said again.

"6? Hex? You are a Hex Actuator?"

"Affirm." Fae\*Dra responded with muted robot pride

"Well now that's quite an asset" .... " Okay... we will make a run for it in the Destiny, but I will need modifications.. Using your credentials I have requisitioned a cluster of four boosters to zoom away. I'm replacing the core with a fusion core... antimatter is far more powerful but requires refueling. I am also having much of the inner battle equipment removed for we will instead need quarters for sleeping and eating and fabrication systems for repairing the ship in deep space... this ship is not made to fly a long mission like this without support after all.

Then a weird thing happened.... a hangar adjacent opened and an empty ship gently drifted to its moorings ready to be repaired and refueled. It looked exactly like The Red Destiny down to the last detail.

"What ship is that?" Lester asked.

"The Forlorn Hope"

"The Decoy ship used in the battle of ILLUS\!" , Lester realized\!

Well, this gives us quite a new asset. We might actually live through this. "Hmmm.... the forlorn hope...."

## CHAPTER WHATS INSIDE IM-RY3 ANYWAY?

Lester now an ally of Fae\*Dra asked politely: “Before we go, I’d like to inspect the cube and make sure its contents are safe.”

Fae\*Dra seemed to approve.

Lester pressed a button and a circle on thecube ejected a canister.  He twisted the canister and through a clear material glowed a floating sapphire gem perhaps 2 carrots in weight… it was a Tzo chrystal.

“A Tzo Chrystal?  Is this what you were saving” Lester asked Fae.

“I rescued IM-RY3”

“So you had no idea what was inside it?”

Fae didn’t seem surprised but Lester was dumbstruck,  “What… is… THIS\!?... What is this thing\!? A TZO CHRYSTAL\!  Where is… .where is my… WHAT HAVE YOU DONE ALEXANDER\!”

In anger he grabbed the crystal which caused an unwanted reaction ….. “AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\!”  he yelled and for Lester everything went black.

## CHAPTER THE WISH STONE

Lester was falling through a warm and humid atmosphere. He felt great.

He struggled to orient himself, but realized his reaction control suit wasn't operational \--no \-- he was naked. The naked situation bothered him more than the terminal velocity situation but then he discovered he was not completely naked just wearing a thin garment he had never seen before. And with that priority addressed he could move on to his lesser concern: being as flat as a pancake in the next few seconds.

Without equipment he had little hope unless the garment could be fashioned into a parashute..... nope... little more than covering his privates.... not enough material.

He fell through the cloud layer and could now see clearly the planet he was falling towards. He was headed to a cliffside by a lake and there were structures. Ruins. It was a precursor planet Lester had not seen before, of course he wasn't well studied on the various precursor sites. He did his best to make a survey of the land before his skeleton became a permanent monument .

Closer he approached. He still felt great for some reason... all worries blown away even the present and deadly one.

And then CRASH\! he hit the ground and created a giant crater. He wasn't instantly knocked unconscious which was a bummer, he thought he'd have to die slowly and he did a mental diagnostic of his body to see what was hurting what would give out first... and he found nothing. He was completely uninjured.

He stood and continued to observe. He walked out of the crater and saw a giant rock seemingly pushed to its side and on it appeared some petrified foot prints that were .... human\!? They had to be millions of years old, how could that be there were no humans then...

In front was a cluster of three thrones and some sort of bird bath all in remarkably good condition. He was facing them from behind and decided to go around to see them from the front.

Then a startle... someone was sitting on one of the lesser thrones\!

It was an old but beautiful looking woman. She seemed thinner than an average person but just as tall and had pointy ears like some kind of elf.

She stood and bowed gracefully "Lester Man" she said.

Tactical Engineers weren't used to people treating them with respect... As a matter of fact respect made Tactical Engineers suspicious. But this lady did have a lovely planet and given the novelty of the situation he was more amenable to giving her a chance…. At the moment Lester couldn’t make himself speak.

“I must speak the words and speak them rightly for we have but a little time in this now.”

“We are the Bringlings.  We are called the Bringlings for we are those who brought this universe into existence.  Some think us gods – although my master rejects such arrogance.  Know that we are of great power and our deeds of heroism are seared into the legend of this universe.  But with time we grew weary and lost the fortitude to defy evil.”

“Gods wish upon a mortal to set something straight in this universe by giving that mortal his power.”

“That is why my master summons you, Lester Mann.  You are her hero and you will make this universe right again or we will all die.”

A magical block on Lester’s voice seem to be lifted.

“But what do you want me to do?”, Lester asked

“More explanations will come, for now know that everything you have done and continue to do is and has been right… we know this because the wish stone chose you”

“In parting you must know some small things.  You face an enemy with power beyond what ou and your companion’s mind can comprehend and are in great peril.   For today: “Run, Run and keep on Running. As you do so you will grow stronger and we will imbue you with many bringling gifts when you are ready.  Run and Run and Run and then one day you won’t run anymore.”

Lester felt a disturbance… the experience was about to end.

“Gift? What gift will you give me? How can i use it?”

“Your first gift has already been given… I lack the time to tell you about it but you will start to feel its presence soon… soon you will be able to use it.

The experience began to shift... colors and sounds became like they were underwater and Lester started feeling light headed.

"But who are you?"

"Ah\! That I can tell you, Lester Mann.... My name is Meru and I am at your service.

The dream ends.

HUMANS TO BE CONTINUED….

BRINGLINGS FINAL

# The Bringling Day of Gifting

On an unnamed field of grass and poppies under the graceful soar of giant preybirds in the kingdom of Wuskia on the Planet Rheashan in the galaxy of the milky way under the Bringling empire and in the universe of resolution a young boy named DyAd practiced swordplay with the prisoner Zetsway guided by the royal knight Deebit.

It was the Bringling day of giving an important day for all things bringling. For all that is got by a bringling is from gifting. And of great importance new skills, spells and magical trinkets are passed as gifts but to be worthy of the best gifts one must first prove his proficiency. And this is why DyAd toiled to secure and prove his skill before the ceremony.

But DyAd was more than a boy... he was actually a boy and two girls and if that wasn't weird enough these merged siblings shared the same mind. Together they were referred to as the Regent Apparent, but individually their names were Tres, DyAd and Monoli Wusk. They shared one body and their appearance would instantly change to the one who was talking .

On some gifting day perhaps today–but likely not–one of the two girls would be the inheritor of the most valuable thing to all Bringlings. It was a gift for girls since Bringling society was matriarchal and the prize was called ‘*The fruit of the Previous life*.’ Controlling Fruit of the Previous life meant absolute rule of all things in the universe of Resolution or so that is what was thought. No one yet had learned how to wield it.

Dyad couldn't care less about the superprize; he just wanted to be a more powerful knight.

His sparing partner Zetsway was an indensured summon of Deebit meaning he could be called to appear at any time and fight. Zetsway was a prisoner of the Bringlings for millions of years still paying off a sentence for a crime only he actually knew.

What he looked like was anyone's guess since an iron mask covered his face also making it impossible for him to speak. Something like a chain metal straight jacket bound his arms behind his back... the chain main ran all the way down to his legs and bound them tightly together too. Finally heavy chains wrapped around his body from his neck to his ankles. From behind his iron mask two yellow and longing eyes told a different story to every individual who thought they saw something in him. Lastly it couldn't be missed that he was filthy ... the only skin that was visible was his unshod feet and it couldn't be determined if he was humanoid feet or not because of the filth.

The aforementioned description of Zetsway makes him seem rather impotent and at this moment he was, but one would be deceived to think that was always the case.... for apart from being able to summon Zetsway from thin air Deebit could also release his confinements one by one. But doing so was said to be dangerous for every encumbrance that was disabled Zetsway became incrementally stronger AND incrementally harder to control. His full power was not known and yet he was formidable even in fraction.

Today Zetsway was living the lowlife by being forced to allow DyAd to swing his sword attacks which Zetsway had been easily dodging all day. It seemed cruel, but DyAd at his level still could not hope to scratch the mysterious Zetsway and so the training went on.

"Now hold steady and gather energy into the blade.... swing\!" , Deebit guided.

"You can do it\!" chimed in Tres.

Upon conducting a downward spin a large disc of wave energy was released from DyAd’s sword and rolled through the air leading up to Zetsway, but missed its target for Zetsway had already side stepped.

"Again\!"

Another swipe and miss. This has been going on for a while.

"They will not give you super speed until you can accurately hit a target while you are NOT moving..." Deebit repeated in frustration.

Monoli sensed her brother's anguish, "Don't feel bad, you are getting closer each time\!" (this wasn't true at all)

"Your eyes are betraying you" the voice was familiar but no one knew where it came from.

"Oh god, where the hell are you this time..", Deebit asked

"Hi There." the man was standing high atop a tree watching with a birds eye view and he wasn’t alone… a tiny Whysan girl no older than 6 stood beside him.  Both disappeared in a puff of smoke and smoked in again behind Dyad… the Whysan girl poofed in nearby.

Dyad then transformed to Monoli "Teacher Modus\!" and she hugged him with great affection. Modus smiled.

"Let's give our DyAd another chance. With your permission, Ser Deebit?"

"Yes , granted... " Deebit sat in the grass clearly weary from teaching young DyAd.

Monoli transformed into DyAd again.

Modus whispered so Zetsway couldn't hear. "He's predicting your aim and strike because you have put all your training and gifts in the pursuit of powerful strikes... and indeed the power of your strikes are formidable... but predictability plus power negates formidablity for you will never land a blow on the opponent wise to your strategy.

Moreover you have no time to learn bending techniques before the gifting ceremony. But you are not yet lost.

To solve your little conundrum I have something for you on this day of gift giving...." Modus produced a small trinket, a loose bracelet with a heavy bobble on the end.

"Wear this and hold the bobble against the hilt with your swinging arm. Now swing as usual and release your energy disc wave."

He does so. The disc wave tumbles towards Zetsway who predictably leaps out of the way.

"Nothing changes" said Tres

"Now try again... this time after you release your disc wave and when it reaches half way to your target let go of the bobble.", Modus instructed

Dyad pulled back and released a fresh energy wave... he saw the moment Zetsway jumped out of its path and then released the bobble.... the disc wave's path then began to arc to the left hitting Zetsway square in the centerline causing a giant smokey explosion"

Dyad transformed into Tres: "Wow\! Unbelievable\!"

Deebit sat up in excitement.

The dust cleared and Zetsway seemed unharmed which was expected.

Tres transformed into Monoli who shouted the spell "Celebration" which caused all the poppies in the field to explode and release a vast confetti of flowers that jetted as high as the stratosphere… and it caused the little whysan girl–who lacked Modus’s skill and the protection of a bringling–caused the girl to be blown high into the sky.

As she fell to the ground Modus caught her… she was covered in flower confetti and having the laugh of her lifetime.

"Who gives you those silly spells"

"Uh..." she looked at teacher modus ... " I don't know.

The laughing girl ran to Monoli Wusk and both gave each other a knowing hug.

“I bind myself to you as your Whysan, my master, Monoli Wusk”

Monoli was overjoyed, “I accept your pledge and bind myself to you… you… what is your name Whysan?”

“Meru”, she said.
