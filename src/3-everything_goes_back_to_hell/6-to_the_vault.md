## CHAPTER TO THE VAULT

Organics traveled through the conveyance by the use of some sort of vehicle, but they were in short supply. Instead Lester hacked the system to think he was a vehicle and he used his Tactical Engineering 'cacoon' a spherical shield which was weak but covered him from all directions and allowed him to bounce off walls from all directions. Another advantage to the cocoon was that it canceled outside inertia... in other words as the little globe was tumbling, bumping, flipping and spinning Lester didn't feel any of it ... to him he was sitting in a small but quiet office working on his next plan.

Of course the cocoon was weak as for mentioned and in battle served little more protection than deflection of debris and the lowest level weapons.

Larger debris like that crashing through the conveyance tubes at the time could easily give Lester a bad day and that's where Nand and Xor came in.

"Boom\!" Xor used his blaster to annihilate an incoming piece of debris then Nand zapped individual shards with her point defence beams

While all tumbled through the windy tubes of the conveyance Nand & Xor argued in bitspeak.

Nand: "Xor is shorted (an idiot)."

Xor: "more" ( more information please)

Nand: "...Blaster create spall... Master in danger. ergo: Xor is shorted."

Xor: "Not. (you're wrong) Nand assist with PDL. Master safe. ergo: Not "

Nand: "Rejected. Tactical pivot:. spacial distortion cone. Supposition: No danger to Master."

Xor: "Rejected. 'Suppasitions are superstitions' say master. â€œ

Nand: Rejected. Supersitions are not suppasitions therefore nonequivilancy.

Xor: "Nand buffer overflows (talks too much). Sollusion Nand \>\> /dev/null (this was an ancient command expression meaning all future communication would be sent to null/garbage.... a joke from Xor) \-- alternative solution: Nand use weld and weld off own head.

As they approached the vault antechamber the conveyance exit hatch opened and critter harpooned a structural pillar and began winding Less into the chamber.

This was a waiting room for people to petition and wait for vault items that had some kind of administrative lock on them and weren't allowed to travel by conveyance summons.
