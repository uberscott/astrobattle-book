# SAFETY IS JUST A FOLD AWAY

Mudd sank in his chair as if stress that had kept him inflated for years just escaped his body.  Then he stiffened again and stood.  He faced the sofa.  *“See\!?”* he said with great agitation.   No one else was in the room.

Mudd was 60-years-old graying with crusty mustache and sporting a uniform with many vanity adornments: metals and other recognitions of accomplishments.

The anxiety level was elevated but not to the point of panic.   The Humans had been in similar spots before and had eluded the Zell by virtue of a very recent discovery: The Fold Drive – a technology the Zell lacked.

The Alliance had installed massive fold drives in each of the three Arks.  The fold aperture could be made large enough to transport many companion vessels, enough to send a convoy with the Arks through a fold in space.

The general populace knew that in a matter of hours the entire human race would be enveloped in a magnificent fold bubble, travel through a bright and chaotic interdimensional tunnel and then reemerge in this universe millions of lightyears away. They knew it would take the Zell years to find them again.

Fold drives were scarce, not because the technology required to create them was cutting edge, but because the heart of every fold drive was enabled by something very rare known as a Tzo crystal. Tzo crystals are precursor artifacts that had been discovered some fifty years prior to the battle of Ilus.  It was only one year prior to the attack of the Zell that scientist had discovered that by subjecting a Tzo crystal to the right energy frequencies it could be coaxed into opening an entry aperture in one point in our universe which tunneled to an exit aperture many millions of lightyears away enabling matter to be moved great distances over a time span that was negligible.

In the fifty years since the Tzo crystal’s discovery only eight had been found and only three of those were adequate for generating folds large enough to move the entire fleet.

It was safe passage via the Ark folds that Mudd had leveraged in order to force Alexander’s surrender.  Mudd held the access keys to all three fold Arks on his person at all times and was in complete control of Human-kinds ability to fold space at the moment.

With Zell encroaching from every angle, folding was the only escape.  Mudd had forced Alexander’s hand by denying his Ronin fleet safe passage unless he finally surrendered.  
Mudd pressed a button and gave orders.  “Prepare for the Ronin’s surrender.  The Red Destiny will be processed by ‘The Hand of God’  All other ships will receive skeleton command structures from the Alliance until we know who can be trusted.”   “The Hand of God” was Mudd’s flagship.  It was a very large capital ship with a powerful main cannon.

The surrender would be very ceremonial which Mudd felt was prerequisite in order for the Ronin’s to accept the change and the populace of the Arks to feel at ease.  Ceremony was required in order for all to digest the change and the way things would be moving forward.  And as mentioned it was of great personal import that Mudd humiliate Alexander in the process for years of personal hurts.

*“That technology is mine now”,* Mudd said to an empty sofa.   He was referring to the many innovations the Ronin’s had made to best the Zell… although the Ronin’s were much smaller they were far more innovative and the benefits of that innovation was now in Mudd’s hands.

He paced in his office speaking to himself pensively.
