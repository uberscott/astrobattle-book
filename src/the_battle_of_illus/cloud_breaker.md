# CLOUD BREAKER 

As the cavalry came to the apogee between the Third and Forth bounce, The Red Destiny and all the cavalry seemed to rev their thrusters to maximum.  Blue contrails became thicker and more violent as if a huge amount of plasma was just about to erupt   
into a huge burst of acceleration, the offensive shields flickered with greater intensity and looked as if they would explode.  And then: The Forth bounce didn't happen.

The Cone formation collapsed with every ship traveling in a different direction  All in the Calvary Lit their boosters, and departed in great speed, leaving the excited Zell in the bulge with nothing but contrails and The Red Destiny.

At that moment the calvarie’s shimmer dissipated and the Zell then saw a host of 60 thousand Ronin ships that past and surrounded the Red Destiny.  Allied Skermishers  began a massive barrage against the Bulge. The cannons of several battleships fired in synchronization.  Total Confusion rained on the other side of the cloud, Some of the Zell couldn't see what had happened to the Red Destiny, others knew what had happened and began a desperate rush to the Center.  Many Zell collided with each other.  In some cases fighting broke out between Zell ships \-- retribution for collisions.

A barrage of torpedo spears hit the Zell cloud right at its thinnest. And snap\! The cloud broke apart in one place…. And in that moment The Red Destiny emerged with 6 companion escorts in tow and zipped through the momentary opening in the Zell cloud.

The trick had been revealed even to the enemy.  The first Red Destiny was a fake… a decoy used to siphon the cloud’s strength and make it snap, creating an opening for the real deal to enter and start causing mayhem where the Zell didn’t want them.

"Thirty seconds till loss of containment.", Fae Reported.

The Red Destiny and Companions passed through the cloud wound on the Zell side.  Behind the cloud many hundreds of thousands of gigantic zell drones produced and belched the green cloud and even more transmitted energy into it.

The companion ships inverted their hexagonal formation like pedals pealing back from a flower and transformed themselves into cannon mode.   A quick build up followed and then simultaneously they emitted a medium powered wide angled blast in a 360 degree spread pattern around the exit wound with the Red Destiny slowing so as not to lose them.

Violent torrents of energy ripped through the unprotected cloud ships, melting and smashing them, creating spall that bounced off other ships for hundreds of kilometers.

The Zell cloud was not then destroyed, but it was compromised and its power was sapping rapidly… total collapse was imminent and the Allied forces then pressed the attack.
