## ON THE ZELL

### HISTORICAL DATAGRAM

 *Observations from Mr. Gary Ungie former inhabitant of Habitat Suzi–a small settlement on the frontier of Human space colonization that was overrun in the initial blitzkrieg by the Zell.  Mr. Ungie's hobby is alien taxonomy.  Mr. Ungie does not have any expert training in this field, however he is presently the most qualified person to report on the Zell.  \[8 years before the battle of ILUS\]*

   The following is my report on my superficial observations of the Zell – which happened while I was in the act of narrowly escaping death – please understand that I have recorded the best information that I could scrounge from my memory which may in some cases be inaccurate because I was under severe duress during that harrowing experience.

   At one point I was fortunate enough to hide in a basement structure with a small upper window with one way glass which gave me a half hour to observe the Zell’s mayhem and murder. It was a very upsetting and terrifying experience watching the slaughter of innocent people that I had now power to help.  I assumed it was only a matter of time before the Zell found me.  Luckily providence intervened and I was picked up by a rescue squad.

   COMMONALITIES  
   I have observed four different types of Zell and I will describe their commonalities first:

   All Zell are covered in a black segmented exoskeleton which seems to serve as armor.  It is not a passive armor but one that is somehow greatly strengthened by this green energy to the point that not a single inhabitant’s civilian weapons have any effect on the Zell.  The armor is rough and bumpy and sometimes has little spiky protrusions.  The surface of the Exoskeleton was unique for every Zell which leads me to conclude that it develops as a genetic pattern rather than an exact template.

   The Zell has arms that terminate in three grasping claw-like fingers which have three bendable segments allowing the Zell’s fingers to bend like ours.  One of the fingers is opposed to the other two so they are capable of picking up objects however I doubt that they can perform any fine motor skills.

   The Zell typically walks hunched over on all fours.  They walk on the knuckles in a motion that is surprisingly similar to a recording I've seen of the Chimpanzee walking pattern–one of the ancient animals from our spawning planet.  They frequently shift to their hind legs when they need to use their hands. They can actually walk bipedally quite well–yet their preferred mode of locomotion is quadrupedal.

   The head is sloped.  Eyes are a glowing green color that matches the flickering green light that sometimes sparks from their armor when they receive a blow.  The mouth is beak-like with sharp serrations  often glowing green drool drips. The larger Zell caste that I will describe momentarily frequently used their beaks to bite off the heads of many unfortunate victims.

   I saw no instance of the Zell using tools or weapons.  It seems that their capabilities were innate.

   The first extraordinary offensive technique I observed was Zell emitting a bolt of destructive energy from his mouth.  The devastating effect was on par with any weapon the humans possessed however all of their weapons seemed to lack precision making up for it by creating a large swath of damage to consume their target.

   The second technique of the Zell was a melee attack.  They would hoist themselves on their back legs and some sort of energized claw would extend from their knuckles approximately 30 cm long.  Absolutely nothing could stop their claws from shredding their people or things.  Again they certainly lacked precision in this attack as well and instead relied on rapid and chaotic slicing which diced equipment and people into small pieces.

   DISTURBING SIDENOTE

   One very disturbing side note: They spoke English proficiently although their grammar was quite poor.  They even spoke to each other in plain english leaving me mystified as to what their original language must have been.  I can supply no reasonable theories to explain this bizarre twist.



BEHAVIOR

Zell seemed to prosecute their task with glee.  They would often cheer for a spectacular kill and they made sounds of disappointment when they encountered the mildest of obstacles to their murdering.



CASTES

There were four distinct forms of the Zell i will now endeavor to describe:



*Rabble*

The Rabble caste was by far the most numerous. This category of Zell measured a mere meter in height. I felt the Zell relied on superior numbers of this caste as the backbone of their waring strategy–however I am not an expert in military strategy.   This caste would often form phalanxes as they encroached upon their victims very similar to the phalanx formations adopted by our War Bots.  They also seemed quite expendable as I observed the death of one Rabble Caste member–not by the hand of a human–but by another Zell presumably as punishment.  They left the dead Zell’s body.  They seem to have no regard for life – not even their own.



*Brute*

A Brute was a gigantic muscle bound caste ranging in height from 3 to 4 meters when

Walking on all fours.  I never observed an instance of a Brute speaking.  The Brutes are the ones that grabbed people in order to bite their heads off.  Unlucky is the human soldier who will find himself in a position where he will have to battle a Brute.



*Boss*

With individuals from the Rabble and Brute castes being so dumb it stands to reason that another smarter caste would be commanding them.  And this seemed to be the Sergeant castes role. Sergeants were small, about ⅓ of a meter.  I actually didn’t even notice them until one started barking out orders to a Rabble phalanx.   I only saw two Sergeants and in both cases they rode upon the back of a Brute.   Unlike all of the other caste members the Sergeants seemed to be more task focused.  They never cheered over a killing or emoted disappointment over a setback.  They did seem to me completely incapable of participating in the battle as their arms and legs were thin to the point that I postulate they may be completely vestigial or at least only good for hanging on and light motion.



*Elite*

By far the most terrifying Caste was the Elite.  Just below 2 meters tall and leaner build than the other Castes.  I only saw one Elite but I assume there are others.  He was deadly like the Brutes and Rabbles yet also intelligent like the Bosses.  As a matter of fact I would say they were more deadly and more intelligent than any caste.



I speculate that this Elite may have authority over the Bosses–but I didn't see definitive proof that this was the case.  I simply gathered from his demeanor and the wide berth given to him by Boss, Brute and Rabble alike as if they respected him.  Perhaps their battle was going as planned and he had no need to command anyone.



The other thing that set this Elite apart from the others was that he was very precise.  I witnessed him leap through the air and stab an unlucky soul through his face.  The Elite’s claw exited the back of his victim’s head and protruded several additional centimeters.  It was absolutely horrid to watch.



CONCLUSIONS

My best theory when I consider the whole of the Zell anatomies is that every feature is for the benefit of warmongering.  Particularly the lack of a hand that can employ fine motor skills leads me to believe that they are incapable of creating the technological feats they displayed.  My guess is that there are other castes-perhaps a science and/or engineering caste that innovates for these creatures.



Thank you for reading my report, I hope it helps repel this vial threat to humanity.

2) *Autopsy & Dissection of Zell corpse recovered from the Battle of Nord performed by Alien Biologist Dr. Frank DeWitt \[7 years before the battle of ILUS\]*

   Before reading this document you should be familiar with the report by part time taxonomist Mr. Gary Ungie.  His accurate and detailed explanation of the Zell’s behavior and external physiology has proven to be consistent with all subsequent observations.



There are a few additive data points observed after Mr. Ungie’s account:

1) The Zell are capable of surviving in the vacuum of space and other environments without need of a pressure suit.  In fact Zell are often seen walking on the surface of their ships.  They clearly mostly stay in the ship’s interior and we have no explanation for why they have space outings.
2) Zell are capable of a weird form of flight.  They can propel themselves with a kind of plasma exhaust that vents from a dorsal segment boundary in their carapace.  The short contrail which shines a bright green color.  They appear to have limited range before they run out of propellant.  Also to be clear an individual Zell cannot perform anything approaching Faster Than Light and they can not catch up to or outmaneuver a ship dedicated to space travel. Their flight capabilities are only employed on a local battlefield in open space or in the atmosphere of a planet.
3) Zell have a great variety and quantity of ships in their fleet–we estimate their total fighting force to be over 3 Billion vehicles.   The Zell vehicles are covered in the same black carapace as the various fighting castes leading us to theorize that Zell ships are actually another caste of Zell that grows itself into a space worthy vehicle that can perform FTL travel.  We’ve been calling this the Ship Caste for lack of a better term.

   This document goes beyond external observations made possible by our brave military that recovered a dead Zell specimen for us to dissect.



We first cut away a portion of the outer armor carapace.  The Zell’s blood was not coagulated to the degree that we would encounter in a human that had been dead for so long, but the Zell’s blood seemed to still be quite fluid although we believe it was more viscous than a live Zell’s blood.



The blood was like nothing we had ever encountered.  It was green in color, but contained tiny sparkles of yellow energetic particles.  We called upon our network of capable experts to examine these particles and to our surprise they turned out to be a refined and highly radioactive substance.   From this we concluded that a Zell does not get its energy from food as we do but instead Zell’s are powered by atomic fission.  They perhaps have a mechanism of refreshing their radioactive blood since our experts determined that the radioactive materials would only last for 20 years.  If they cannot replenish their blood then we believe the maximum lifespan of a Zell is 20 years.



We also sent several carapace samples out for analysis and scanning and determined that the carapace was laced with a special cell that did not seem as if it naturally evolved in the Zell but was perhaps inserted into them before birth.  These cells gave the Zell’s carapace the ability to energize and maintain its strength that regular projectiles, beam attacks or energy blasts could not hope to penetrate.



Things got particularly interesting the moment we reached the creature’s throat.  For we saw the terminus of what certainly provided the Zell with the ability to emit energy bolts.  The structure reached deep into what would normally be a stomach but instead was a fascinating technology laced object.  It's important to note that this object seemed similar to the foreign cells in the carapace but was certainly not a match for any of the Zell’s natural biology.



The object itself appeared to be glass-like although it was some other type of transparent material we have not encountered before.   The object held the shape of an ancient vacuum tube if you have ever seen one in your history lessons.   Inside there was a vast network of technology that we are still attempting to understand.  The insides seemed to be white but held a slightly pale green tint and this green color was not a match with the Zell’s many green emotions or blood.



We continued to dismantle our specimen and made several other instances of this vacuum tube like mechanism. They varied in size and for most of them it was obvious what their purpose was.



For example we discovered a large mechanism that seemed to control and be fused with the Zell’s flight apparatus located on the fifth segment break of the dorsal side.   The flight controller was directly connected to two large biological bladders which was filled with liquid hydrogen obviously because it was the main propellant employed when the Zell was flying.



We removed multiple enhancements for the arms and legs.  Our best guess is that the technology was used to convert radioactive fuel, a powerful chemical consumed by the Zell’s muscles in order to facilitate super strength.



And there were several “Vacuum Tube” like components found throughout the body that we still don’t have an explanation for.



In conclusion here are the takeaways derived from this effort (all of which are theoretical and at this point unprovable yet valuable in our journey of understanding our foe):



1) The Zell seem to have a very fluid biology in their gestation phase.  They seem to be able to ‘engineer’ special bodies.   Not only can they create something like a ship, but that can easily encapsulate foreign technologies that did not evolve with them naturally.
2) We have long assumed that the Zell have a science and/or engineering caste which is directing their evolution and incorporation of other technologies.
3) We think it likely that the Zell has a partnership with another species that supplies their cybernetic enhancements

   Thank you for your kind attention to our results.  We hope these insights lead to the total defeat of the Zell someday.
