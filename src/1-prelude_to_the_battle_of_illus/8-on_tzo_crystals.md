## ON TZO CRYSTALS

#### *45 YEARS BEFORE THE BATTLE OF ILUS.*

*\[Request for funding rational by Dr. David Tzo on the recent discovery of a certain precursor artifact\]*

We have long known of the Precursors, an alien species that died out over a million years ago which possessed fantastical technologies that we are only beginning to unravel.

Over the years Archeological efforts led by Dr. Ken Moore and his team have discovered a variety of Precursor Artifacts.  Typically, these artifacts are found in vast cave structures inside massive asteroids which seem to have served as burial chambers. Most of the artifacts seemed inert yet Dr. Moore and his team have proved proficient in gleaning the utility of the artifacts.  From his discoveries we are many times humbled by the achievements of the Precursors; they were clearly far, far ahead of our own progress\!

About ten years ago Dr. Moore discovered an artifact that he could not explain.  It was a small crystal about 3 carrots in weight and in the form of a hexahedron with the top and bottom points protruding slightly more than the other points.  The crystal was internally flawless and one could not be blamed for staring at it for hours.  It was impossible to ascertain the material that the crystal was made of… no instrument could measure any of the crystal's internal features; apparently its study ended at the surface of the artifact.  Dr. Moore eventually moved on to more promising artifacts and placed the crystal in a display in his office where it sat for the next five years.

By pure chance an evacuation caused by a minor radiation leak from a nearby reactor caused Dr. Moore to hastily pack up the essentials in his office.  As he started to make a quick break to safety he passed the crystal and noticed that it was emitting a very slight pulsating glow of some kind of light.  He identified the light as a color he couldn’t  really explain… in denser regions of the light it seemed to create a region which completely confused his senses.  He then grabbed the crystal and excitedly escaped danger.  He surmised that the crystal was reacting to the radiation indicating that it was some kind of power source.  Over the months he subjected the crystal to various radiations in some cases the “mystery hue” light would emanate from the crystal.  Unfortunately he came to the limits of his expertise regarding this artifact and decided to seek an expert.

I’m grateful that Dr. Moore chose me to continue the research.  I am an expert in energy dynamics ranging from force fields to gravimechtrons.  I’m familiar with all the known forms of energy that human beings have encountered thus far and I follow the latest theoretical progress in the fields of wormholes, extra universal dimensions, and the exploration of possible exotic types of energies that have yet to be discovered.   My team and I have been working with Dr. Moore for the last 5 years trying to crack mysteries of this crystal.

I should add that due to the many findings I have published, Dr. Moore and his team have graciously named the artifact a *Tzo* crystal after me.  I’m not sure that I deserve this honor but Dr. Moore was quite insistent despite my protests.  At first, I cringed every time I said *Tzo Crystal*, but Dr. Moore was quite adept at something resembling group therapy by reminding me that he has a great number of artifacts already named after him, and it doesn’t bother him a bit.  Okay… well… so it's called a Tzo Crystal now. I now accept this extreme honor without protest.

Early in my research I discovered that a variety of energies other than radiation that the Tzo crystal has even more pronounced reactions too. In some experiments it gets so bright that the naked eye cannot behold it.   And I soon discovered that by varying properties of the energy in the form of frequency, modulation and wavelength, the Tzo crystal would have different observable reactions as if these energies were somehow a way to control a Tzo crystal.

I am obligated to disclose that communication with the crystal is just a hunch not yet explainable with empirical evidence.  I mention it because I have never been prone to altering my behavior because of a hunch yet this one gnaws at me in an atypical way.  Also, this hunch is shared by all who have viewed a demonstration of the Tzo crystals responses.  It can’t be explained, yet it deserves mention as a weird curiosity.

In one exciting reaction the Tzo crystal not only shone brightly with its unworldly hue, but it was producing a vast amount of energy that exceeded the input energy by many magnitudes. In fact the first time I stumbled upon this I struggled to shut down the reaction before my test chamber was overwhelmed.

The energy output of the Tzo crystal was an exotic form of energy that up until that time had been purely theoretical.  I invited many acolytes of the theory for an observation session and there is wide conviction that it fits enough criteria of the theory to declare it a match.  Of course in science there are always some decent viable alternative explanations.

In my opinion this energy brought by the Tzo crystals has the potential to transform human society to something we cannot even image. 

And now I conclude my request for funding by stating that it is ESSENTIAL that this research continue.  With proper understanding we may someday be able to control the Tzo Crystal’s abilities.  I believe if that can be accomplished it will result in the greatest benefit so far in the human experience.

*\[rationale to extend funding on the Tzo Crystal artifact submitted by Dr. David Tzo.\]*

I wish to share news of my progress uncovering the nature of the Tzo crystal.  Please make yourself familiar with my initial request for funding as this document builds upon that.

Outside our lab Dr Ken Moore continues to be resilient in his quest.  He has discovered two additional Tzo crystals.  One of them is a whopping 5 carrots in weight and another is less than half a carrot.  He has turned over both artifacts to my lab where we reproduced the results of several experiments conducted on the original Tzo crystal.

Aside from confirming reproducible results with the new Tzo Crystals we have diligently pursued a greater understanding of Tzo crystals in general.

I’m excited to announce that we believe we have proven the use of the Tzo crystal to the precursors, and it was nothing we could have expected.  The Tzo crystal is actually the key to opening a portal to another dimension! We have discovered that a Tzo crystal can connect our universe to another universe that emits pure energy – a lot of energy\!  The Tzo crystal does not produce energy itself but instead merely opens a portal to the energy dimension.  The portal spews energy into our world–an unlimited and vast amount of energy.   The Size of the power output seems to be directly proportional to the size of the Tzo Crystal.

After our shocking discovery we worked for nine more years to expand the size of the portal from microscopic up to reaching a diameter of one meter.  At that time we started to attempt to send objects through the portal but were met with a new obstacle.

The portal geometry was foamy and chaotic.  It roughly resembled a bubbly and distorted sphere.  All the objects that we pushed through were violently ripped to pieces by vibrating and misaligned forces in the portal.

For the last four years leading up to now we have been focused on stabilizing the portal.  We have made astounding progress.  About six months ago the portal had grown in size to 3 meters and was stable enough to receive a stone obelisk without destroying it.  It should be noted that we have a long way to go as the portal is still chaotic and the obelisk had such a rough ride that even the most resilient of our organic specimens would have been killed for sure.

That is where the research lies today.  Now allow me to frame our progress in the form of what this means for our future!

I believe that if we continue at our current progress we will be able to achieve space folding in less than 5 years.

What is folding?  Well, currently our most rapid form of travel is our Faster Than Light drives which allow vehicles to traverse space linearly.   FTL speed has been improved many times over the past few millennia since its discovery, however, FTL will always suffer from a drawback put upon it by the sheer vastness of infinite Space.   Every advancement in speed extends the range that we can travel to and yet no speed imaginable will ever be able to take us to everywhere we might want to go.

Folding Space allows a ship to enter a portal geometry in one place and then exit at any point in the universe in an instant.  In short Space Folding has been the holy grail that scientists and engineers have sought for centuries.  It will bring our awareness from a small sector in our greater galaxy to the universe itself\!

In summary, Please approve the funding to allow this important research to continue.  I promise that someday the continuation of this work will yield unparalleled fruit providing more benefit to our species than the discovery of fire itself\!
