## Girl vs the ZELL

Lester's 3rd plan to foil the girl with super powers was by way of stealth and help from the Zell and most importantly he resolved to abandon ethics.

Of course Less and the Zell weren't allies, but it stood to reason that if she got into a fight with a large host of Zell she would either flee, leaving the cube or get killed.

Lester figured the Zell themselves would have no interest in the cube and when they left he could retrieve it later so long as a Tekanoin salt shaker parade didn't clepto its way through the aftermath later.

Less watched from an air vent high, high in the ceiling of a large spacecraft repair bay. As the girl casually walked towards the hanger \-- her presumed destination \-- two squads of Zell would be injected by Xor and Nand.

Anyone who thought they could herd Zell doesn't know the Zell, but Lester had a great plan. Lester had equipped Critter with his bomblets and given him a little training on the proper care and feeding of high yield explosives and sent him off to harass the Zell in various places. He also equipped the tiny robot with a megaphone speaker attachment so he could play recordings like "Zell are stink... They need ath bomb" BOOM\!

Of course such obnoxious behavior caused the Zell to chase Critter who was able to escape at lightening speed (including the ability to use exceed to avoid blast bolts and tractor whips.) And it was to this point, far below a large invading army of Zell spilled into the maintenance room spoiling for a fight with a little monkey bot who just zipped past a little girl as if to say "if you wanna get to me you gotta go through this single layer cardboard box first.

The girls stopped cold and this was a good sign that she knew she faced a challenge... the sinister agents of the Zell slowed as they approached her.  Among them were at least fifty rabble and three Brutes--each of whom bore a Zell boss. They would surely tear that precious thing to bits.

Lester’s look of satisfied anticipation gave way to a more empathetic expression, "What have I done." He whispered. But I have to have it.”  Then from her backpack some things emerged. One, Two, Three floating blades detached and surrounded her–their pointy sides facing the enemy. The blades were each about 30 centimeters in diameter and perfectly triangular.

Each vertex was a sharp cutting edge. They could fly in any direction but on one of the edges was a flattened booster.

"Kill her" a Zell boss fired off this command nonchalantly and a single rabble charged towards her... when he got near two blades stopped him by pressing their flat sides on either edge of his belly to give him a squeeze.  Trapped as he was he could not stop her from floating him directly over the Zell boss that gave the order to attack and while he hovered there the third blade cut the floating Zell in two releasing all its blood an innards over the Zell boss.

All blades returned to their starting position flanking the girl. The entire move seemed to be an

opening warning from Fae telling the Zell, "Don't try me"

"Sprawl, you moron... can't even kill a girl.... YOU ATTACK\!", the 2nd Zell boss thought he could do better and another non-descript Rabbel launched the exact same attack.

But as he approached he was bonked on the head by a suddenly appearing blade on the blunt side with such force that he did a back flip right overtop the 2nd Zell boss.  At the moment a second blade severed the animal in two right through the anus. Blood and guts rained all over the 2nd Zell boss.

"Ha Ha HA\! YOu crimping fools, you can't even kill a simple human without getting slop all over you." Lester recognized this Zell's voice for it was Vraylar once again.

"We really need to kill that guy next time", Lester thought

"We do not fear your trapazoids, girl", the first Zell said.

"They aren't trapezoids, they are rectangles\!", said the second Zell.

"Fool, you don't know your weapons. They are trapezoids because first they trap you then they slice you" said the first"Wrong, they are Rectangles... didn't you see how they enter through the rectum?"

"Idiots\!" It was Vraylar's turn to 'add' to the conversation.... "They are TriAngles, because I will win on the third attack with three Zell. I will demonstrait.... Triple attack now\!"

But before any assailant could take a step to threaten her all three in Vraylar's attack group had lost their heads and the girls weapons seemed to have returned already... ready for the next wave.

"Charge her\!" Vraylar said with anger fueled by his pride.... a LARGE number this time, between 20 and 30 Zell launched a melee attack... Fae\*Dra simply stood there, completely unconcerned. They pounced on her and tore the area to threads... then paused... one Zell looked to Vraylar and said "She's gone" Then a large piece of equipment fell from the ceiling killing all thirty asialants.'

Lester spoke to himself, “keep underestimating this one…”  The he saw the cube laying safely away from the carnage.  He didn't know where she was only that now was his time... with the help of Critter he began his decent to the surface.

"Where is she? Where did she go?" Vraylar said with bruised pride.

"yo." She replied. She was standing on Vraylar's brute directly behind Vraylar.

The two other Brutes saw this and lunged to attack her, but when they got there both her and Vraylar’s brute had been moved to another location in an instance..... the two Brutes ended up tearing each other to bits also killing their riders.

The remaining twenty or so Zell were now in a frenzy of fear and from atop the last Brute she fully released her three blades which started flying in a tight spiral pattern all around her position. Zell and Zell body parts were being tossed around like they were in a cyclone of razor blades with the girl in the eye

of the storm.

Less' feet were firmly planted on the ground about 10 meters from the cube ...he tip-toed as best he could to retrieve it before his distraction was done for.

The screams from the Zell had stopped, yet she let the 'blender' run for a few more seconds for good measure.

Then sillence.

Vraylar looked straight up to see the girl behind him.... he started yanking the reins frantically trying to get it to save him, then he looked down and realized he was sitting on a floating head.

The girl was pointing at him, presumably with a tractor finger causing him and the head to float. The body of the Brute was ruined on the floor and the girl herself was just floating in the same place before she decapitated her stand.

Vraylar undid his stirrups and the head fell to the ground.... the girl twisted him around to face her.

Less grabbed the cube and started running to the extraction point where

Critter waited to whisk him away...

The girl looked at Vraylar for a second then reversed the polarity and increased the pulse strength of her finger tractor sending poor Vraylar flying into a wall 300 meters away. Splat\!

Lester ran and was almost to Critter when all the sudden something hit him in the buttocks so hard it flipped him upside down.... as he sailed through the air he was hit in the butt probably another dozen or so times. And when he crashed in a pile of debris he realized the cube was gone.

"Spankings are for TacEng, because Alexander say no kill TacEng."

The Cube floated back to her, she turned and continued walking like she had just encountered a minor obstacle.

Pause of defeat…"I don't have a chance of beating her" Lester said as he rubbed his heinie.  But… she said “Alexander….”

He performed more facial closeups and did some image enhancements and cross photo computer analysis and then \-- no way. He recognized this person. This was his brother's Androsynth. Lester's blood boiled, "What in the hell is he doing with my vault cube\!" ... he furiously tried to raise him on the comms but nothing. Lester assumed he was in some battle somewhere... the world was going to hell but he wanted his answer anyway.

Ok. all bets are off. I'm going to talk to this androsynth before she gives the cube to Alexander. And if either of them get in my way all bets are off. I've beaten you before, you know…
