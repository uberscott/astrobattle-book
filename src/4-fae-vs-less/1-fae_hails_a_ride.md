## FAE\*DRA HAILS A RIDE

A Utility Engineer was probably the lowest lifeform in the universe that required an advanced degree.   They held the unkind designation of being called ‘Undies’--not because they were some sort of twisted underwear inspectors (although that would be a promotion)-- they were Undies because they were the only role under that of the Tactical Engineer “Supporties”.  It was a cruel and stupid hierarchy.

An Undie was usually tasked with cleanup work including: collecting debris, installing ordinance, operating high tech equipment and really every job that you can imagine but wouldn’t want to imagine.

Mike and Sal were two undies working on a micro tug cleaning up after the battle of Illus.  Their present charge was the detection, evaluation and extraction of any damaged equipment that might have value.  At the moment Mike and Sal were attempting to tow a derelict drone ship back to the flotilla.

The drone was recoverable, but gnarled from battle and unwieldy which made it tumble when towed. Any attempt to get the drone back to the flotilla with standard techniques would result in tumbling and that would mean slower speed, constant reacquisition of target and high difficulty in steering.

The cockpit of the tug was very cramped and had little room for the two engineers.  The space reserved for a center console had been torched off in favor of a makeshift spaceworthy chess table with actual physical pieces.

They discussed the issues with the cargo and the most efficient way to get the valuable wreckage back to the flotilla:

“The front is bent back like a goose with a broken neck.” Mike said as he sipped his coffee.

“We need to get some bot to cut it off and weld it to the back somehow to make the weight distribution nice and even,” Sal proposed.

Mike: “That’ll take a while.  Why not oscillate the tractor beam and booster assembly to cancel the wobble instead.  It can be done by computer instead of chopping stuff off”

Sal: “Ah, good idea…. \*sigh\* We’ll be back to work in no time.”

They both stared at the chess game for a while.  They were 20 moves in.

Mike: “Of course with YOUR idea we can get the bot to do the work and play more chess.  No one needs to know we aren’t dummies.”

“Of  course we can’t let them know that”, Sal conspired.

Suddenly the drone experienced a catastrophic explosion.

“Did you do that?”, Sal asked.

“No, but it would have been a good idea.  Now we can say it exploded right before we got to the Flotilla.  Even more time for chess\!”

But there would be no chess.  A large crash rocked the tug and the internal atmosphere completely evacuated.  Sal and Mike's Utility Engineering overalls spared their lives with fast acting temporary helmets for  
protection from the harshnesses of space.

"Who shoots a Tug?" Sal asked inquisitively.

"She does I guess." Mike pointed to a pretty girl that floated into the craft like an invited guest.

Repair bots from all over the ship scurried to the wound like blood platelets and rapidly applied temporary measures to restore pressure to the vessel.

"Undies give control" Fae\*Dra commanded.

"Welll, we’re not supposed to do that" Mike

“Yeah, like… we could lose our jobs.” Sal mentioned.

“Undies give control or no more Undies..”

“Oh\!  You’re gonna kill us if we don’t?  They can’t fire us for that.  It’s yours..”

Control was transferred and Fae\*Dra immediately changed the operational parameters and got the tug under way… under very way VERY fast.

"Uhm.... you are running the thrusters at 135%. their recommended operational level is 65%. We  
don't ever go over 65%...."

“Undie's stay quiet" was Fae\*Dra's reaction.

They reached the Red Destiny.

"The Red Destiny\!?" We're not allowed to tow elite ships like this\!" (noresponse)

Time passed.

Sal looked at Mike then the chess board and shrugged.  They started playing.

.The Tow made little sounds prepping for an unusual tractor grab… a lot of cutting could be heard and the undies witnessed important parts of the Tug floating off in space.

“Uhhm…. “  Sal started to speak, but thought it not worth the effort to be ignored again.

Then the boosters ignited with power its handlers knew not it had and the  
tow and Red Destiny made its way back to the Flotilla rapidly.

A large piece of the ship made a sound like it broke and splintered all to hell.

“I think one of the tractor emitters just got yanked out of its  socket,” Mike pointed.

“not safe" Sal added

"Undies stay quiet", She commanded.

Sal was reasonable and  lent to Fae\*Dra and kindly  
informed: “We'll help you with your mission, but the thing is, the way you are  
flying the tow it could up exploding…”\[pause\]”... exploding with us inside it.”

"Then undies can play Chess in space. " A portal open and the gaseous  
innards of the tug escaped a second time nearly blowing Mike completely  
out of the ship.

Mike pulled himself back in and rationalized, "We don't like to play chess in space. All the pieces float away and then Sal accuses me of cheating..."

from Sal: "What we mean is the ship could blow up.” PAUSE. “With YOU in it” …  Also a pause. “And we don’t want YOU to get blown up.”  final pause … “or do you?”

"Can't die in space" she seemed to be referring to how she could live in a vacuum and answered in a way that should end the conversation.

Sal gave a smile.... “but girl. WE”-- (indicating himself and Rekseop) “WE can die in space. I understand it is quite pleasant for you."

Now done with this conversation Fae charged her finger beam and pointed it to the Chess game board.

"Undie's quiet else:" She zapped the Chess board with minimal energy and it went up in minor  
Flames.

"Trump card" Mike said as both extinguished the fire and saved enough pieces.

They looked at each other and accepted that there was no way around being towed back to the Flotilla by a small crazy girl with a powerful finger beam that could easily vaporize their beloved hobby and then Themselves then evacuate the atmosphere venting their charred ashes into space.  That was the whole of the situation.

A long pause.

“This really isn’t even a strange day for an Undie”, Sal added.

Fae Dra's finger began to draw power again and both Undies snapped back to  
Playing chess like they had important work to do...
