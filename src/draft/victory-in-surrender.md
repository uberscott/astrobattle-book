## VICTORY IN SURRENDER

Somewhere in the universe insignificant dots fought each other over things unimportant to the cosmos--or so it seemed.  The dots composed two rival flocks. The first was of the Humans--you may have heard of them. The other the Zell: hideous little monsters that seemed to really love violence even when the violence was perpetrated against themselves.  Their obsession made them comical little fellows--well 'comical' to one who could overlook all the mass murder.  The Humans couldn't overlook mass murder and therefore: War!

The ships of the unwelcome Zell devils were made of organic materials--as a matter of fact a Zell spaceship WAS a type of Zell that had grown into a mobile craft.  The outer hull was of hardened black carapace which had an uneven and random bumpiness to it and from any opening or crevice a sickly green glow emanated.  The Zell themselves could survive in space and often walked on the surface of their ships.

On the surface of one large Zell ship a runty Zell named Slatch sat attentive to the distant fireworks. Slatch looked to his side as his friend Greebz approached.  

Greebz: "Me thougtz we giving supplies, Why the humans come play with us?"

Slatch: "Igumz say humans give us nice 'ambush'"

Greebz: "Thanks Humans!"

The two Zell watched as the battle continued to unfold. Slatch was correct: the nature of this minor skirmish was that of the humans attacking a Zell supply run.  Most space battles of this era started with phalanx formations and shield wall contradictions, however, the Zell lines never got a chance to form on this day and the humans were already mopping up the disarray.  

Some pensiveness grew in Greebz body...

Greebz: "Me am bored! Why-fore they not come get us!? " 

Slatch: "Am too.  Me want kill some humans then get blowed up by humans--not sit and watch other Zell have fun!"

The surface of the Zell ship gave a great rumble.

Greebz: "Huh?"

Rubbling and crashing sounds increased.

Slatch: "What those guys doing in there?"

The Surface started to swell.  

Greebz: "Is they having more fun in there than we is on here?"

Suddenly cracks started to form over the superstructure.

Slatch: "Wowie!"

Cracks ripped all over the surface.  The light emanating from the cracks turned from Zell green to the red of fire. 

Slatch & Greebz: "YAAAAAAAY!"

The ship burst beneath their feet sending both Zell sailing into space.

Slatch & Greebz: "We love you HUMAAAAAAANS!"

From the exit wound burst The Red Destiny.  A sleek and state-of-the-art attack craft. 

The Red Destiny had just executed her signature move: a shearing attack.  By temporarily property shifting density to a million times that of a diamond and activating her razon offensive shields The Red Destiny could slice through any ship unprotected by energized armor.

The Red Destiny banked and boosted towards the center of the fray.  

Inside her cockpit another drama unfolded:
