The cause of the multi-fleet situation was rooted in what the Zell had done, which requires some explanation:

The Zell were creatures that had no redeeming qualities.  They were everything bad: violent, nasty and sadistic. Life \-- even their own lives--held no importance to the Zell.  A small number of elite Zell were formidable  warriors, but most individual Zell known as the Rabble were no match for the average warbot or human soldier.  Zell would not be scary at all if they didn’t exist in such massive numbers.  Countless Zell cruised the galactic sectors engaging in their favorite pastime of warmongering with the Humans… As a matter of fact the Zell ONLY seemed to hate the Human species and ignored all others.

Humans had been forced to abandon their homeworld of Earth more than a thousand years before they encountered the Zell in a completely unrelated conflict. And after humans became space faring nomads for a while they flourished in unexpected ways.  Humans thrived for hundreds of years, developing technology for faster than light travel and spreading and befriending many diverse species in their sector of the galaxy.

Before the Zell the local galactic neighborhood was sparsely populated with Human colonies and settlements. The overwhelming bulk of humans were clustered among seven mega populations – each containing many billions of inhabitants and each an independent sovereignty with a fleet of ships for defense.  Four of these populations were traditional planets and three more were giant space Arks–human constructions that housed billions of tenants.

The initial Zell blitzkrieg eight years prior took the human race completely by surprise.  The many Minor Colonies and Settlements were immediately wiped out.  And the planetary civilizations fell within the first two years of the war.  In space combat stationary assets are exceptionally challenging to protect.

The Arks had survived by virtue of their mobility.   In the three years before the battle of Ilus the  location of the Arks was unknown to the Zell.   But that had just changed.   On the other side of the Rift of Ilus a Zell fleet waited. An uncountable number of Zell reinforcements approached from many directions.  In two days the entire human race would be completely surrounded.  Battle projections – which normally varied between outcomes of victory or defeat – seemed to be in rare agreement that the human race was doomed and only differed in predicting how long the defeat would take (with ranges between several hours to several minutes.)

The Alliance fleet was vast.  It was composed of the fleets from the only intact governments from the remaining three Arks.  In the middle portion of the war the Alliance fleet had barely held its own against the Zell.  After experiencing significant losses in a battle three years prior the Alliance fleet adopted a purely defensive posture choosing to protect the Arks forsaking attack.

By contrast The Ronin fleet was small – about one fourth the size of the Alliance fleet.  Unlike the Alliance, Ronins were not the lap dogs of any government yet had formed in the absence of political influence.   The fleet had grown over the years by annexing military remnants once bound to the now gone planetary sovereignties and included dislodged warships, scientists, engineers, space factories and all the resources to facilitate a respected war machine.

Alexander was the leader of the Ronins… actually he WAS the Ronin fleet.  The Fleet existed because of his brashness, his charisma, his magnetic leaderships, his vision, his ambition and his uncanny ability to produce victories from seemingly impossible scenarios.  He spread hope to the disenfranchised elements that had lost their homeworlds speech by speech, stirring them to a greater cause… making them part of the effort that would not only save the human race but actually defeat the Zell.

The central difference in doctrine that set the two fleets apart:  The Alliance meant to merely survive the Zell while the Ronins meant to completely destroy them.  Most believed fleet unification was prerequisite to achieving either goal therefore the dire situation of the Zell’s encroachment created great urgency for unification.

Back to the tense meeting: In a resigned fashion Alexander delivered the climactic proclamation:  “I will come to you in ‘The Red Destiny’ for the surrender six hours from now,"  The Red Destiny was Alexander’s attack ship and its exploits were somewhat famous, known to humans and Zell alike.  The offer was irresistible to Mudd and his counterparts would soon be taking custody of the very symbol of the Ronin fleet.

“AND you will make a speech.  A unifying speech announcing that your fleet will be peacefully folded into the Alliance under Commander Mudd.” A Second politician inserted.

Surrender wasn’t enough… for everything Alexander had put them through the only remedy was public humiliation.

Alexander shut his eyes, tilted his head slightly backwards and inhaled as if he accepted poison into his body and said “I will make a speech.”

The holograms seemed satisfied and they faded away like ghosts that had fulfilled their earthly purpose and now had only to be whisked away to the afterlife.

The light intensity of the room slowly increased.  Alexander’s posture shed all signs of duress and he began reviewing strategic plans on his console.

On a sofa off to the side of the room sat a small girl previously shrouded by the darkness. She stared into space with her silvery eyes. She had shoulder length white hair and her skin was like porcelain with slightly rosy cheeks. One would judge her to be about nine-years-old although she was actually quite older.  Some that witnessed her would be bothered by a certain indescribable artifice about her and this was because she was not just a human but actually a very special type of cyborg known as an Androsynth.   Her name was Fae\*Dra and she was Alexander’s constant companion and partner in his many mayhems.
